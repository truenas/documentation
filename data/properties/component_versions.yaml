# Works in conjunction with shortcodes/component-versions.html
# The shortcode generates a table containing ordered component versions for each minor version release.

# Add in component version information for each minor version release of a major version.
# A major version can be individually called in release notes with {{< component-versions "##.##" >}}

# Each list section (major_version, release_order, and release) should start with the latest and move toward older releases.
# Insert new major or minor version release data above existing entries.
