# Technologies

* [CommonMark ](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/) and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) governs the syntax for content files.
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (extended version) builds the website from the content files and governs the file organization, naming, front matter, and some of the [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) syntax. 
* The custom [GeekDocs theme](https://geekdocs.de/) provides a bare-bones theme with templates and shortcodes for styling the website and content.
* Specific .css customizations are added on top of GeekDocs in the /static/custom.css, /data/menu/, and /layouts/ files
