**August 21, 2018**

The FreeNAS development team is pleased to announce the availability of the sixth update to FreeNAS 11.1.

This bug fix release addresses the following security vulnerabilities:

* FreeBSD-SA-18:08.tcp: Resource exhaustion in TCP reassembly
* FreeBSD-SA-18:10.ip: Resource exhaustion in IP fragment reassembly
* CVE-2018-10858: Insufficient input validation on client directory listing in libsmbclient
* CVE-2018-10918: Denial of Service Attack on AD DC DRSUAPI server
* CVE-2018-10919: Confidential attribute disclosure from the AD LDAP server
* CVE-2018-1139: Weak authentication protocol allowed
* CVE-2018-1140: Denial of Service Attack on DNS and LDAP server

"It also fixes the Known Issues documented in [FreeNAS 11.1-U5]({{< relref "11.1U5.md" >}}). Users of 11.1 systems are encouraged to update to U6 using the instructions in the Guide."

## Known Impacts

SMB1 has been disabled by default for security reasons. If legacy clients are no longer able to connect, type this command in the Shell, then restart the SMB service:

`sysctl freenas.services.smb.config.server_min_protocol=NT1`
If that resolves the issue, you can make that setting permanent by going to System → Tunables →Add Tunable and creating a Tunable with these settings:

Variable: `freenas.services.smb.config.server_min_protocol`

Value: NT1

Type: Sysctl

## Known Issues

Due to a migration bug, it is currently not possible to upgrade from 11.1-U6 to 11.2-BETA2. Please wait til 11.2-BETA3 is available before attempting to upgrade from 11.1-U6.
