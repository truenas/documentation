The scrub and resilver algorithm implement substantial speed improvements which will be most noticeable on fragmented pools.

Resilver Priority has been added to Storage. Resilvering, which rebuilds the storage array, can now be run at a higher priority at configurable times and days of the week.

## Hardware Support

The hardware watchdog has been reenabled for recent firmware versions of AsrockRack C2750D4I. The BMC bug which required the watchdog to be disabled is resolved with the 00.35.00 or newer BMC firmware version.

## IPMI

The Identify Light button has been added to identify a system in a rack by flashing its Unit ID light.

## Cloud Support

Cloud Credentials has been added to System, providing a secure connection with cloud service providers. Supported services include Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Backblaze B2, and Google Cloud Storage.

Cloud Sync has been added to Tasks, giving the capability of synchronizing files or directories with remote cloud storage.

## Virtual Machines

VMs have received significant improvements, including:

selecting which NIC is used by the VM, and setting the MAC address for the VM NIC.
specifying the sector size used by the emulated disk.
selecting the VNC screen resolution, the IP address to bind to, the VNC password, and the option to use the Web version of VNC.
the option to create a Docker instance based on RancherOS.
