TrueNAS Community users are also welcome to report bugs in the TrueNAS Jira project instance directly ([issue reporting guide](https://www.truenas.com/docs/contributing/issuereporting/jiraissuereporting/)).

When reporting an issue, download a system debug file taken immediately following the issue occurrence.
This captures the system configuration information and logs the TrueNAS team needs to help resolve your issues.

{{< expand "How to download a debug file" "v" >}}
{{< include file="/static/includes/CreateDebugSCALE.md" >}}
{{< /expand >}}

Upload this debug to the private attachments area using the link provided when you open a Jira ticket.
After uploading the file, link the attachment to the Jira ticket number before you click **Save**.

Support is also available through the TrueNAS community forums, blog, and Discord.
These options are accessible on the top header of the TrueNAS Documentation Hub website and from the links at the bottom of all articles.
