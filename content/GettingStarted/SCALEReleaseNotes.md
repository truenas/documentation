## Upgrade Notes

* TrueNAS is an appliance built from specific Linux packages.
  Attempting to update TrueNAS with `apt` or methods other than the web interface can result in a nonfunctional system.

* All auxiliary parameters can experience changes between TrueNAS major versions due to security and development changes.
  We recommend removing all auxiliary parameters from TrueNAS configurations before upgrading as these settings can result in SMB share failures after an upgrade.

* {{< include file="/static/includes/UpgradeClearCache.md" >}}

* 24.10 moves the applications backend from Kubernetes to Docker ([announcement](https://forums.truenas.com/t/the-future-of-electric-eel-and-apps/5409)).

  * Supported catalog applications automatically migrate to Docker deployments on upgrade from from 24.04 (Dragonfish) to Electric Eel.
  
    App migration is receiving active development in 24.10-BETA.1.
    To see which applications currently support automatic migration, see the [Parity Status with truenas/charts](https://github.com/truenas/apps?tab=readme-ov-file#parity-status-with-truenascharts) chart from the /truenas/apps/ github repository.
    Applications that support migration display a green check (âœ…) in both **Added** and **Migrated** columns.
    Check back regularly and note the update history of the [README.md](https://github.com/truenas/apps/blob/master/README.md) file for the latest developments.

    Configuration data for applications that do not automatically migrate is retained in the ixapplications dataset.
    You can re-initiate migration of previously-installed Kubernetes apps to Docker at any time after upgrading to Electric Eel, for example to migrate an app that was not yet available for automatic migration upon upgrade but is now available.
    From a shell session enter {{< cli >}}midclt call -job k8s_to_docker.migrate *poolname*{{< /cli >}}, where *poolname* is the name of the applications pool.

  * Custom apps are not supported for migration on 24.10-BETA.1.
  The **Custom App** installation screen is disabled.
  A redesigned screen, including Docker Compose support, is anticipated for the RC.1 version.
  Users wishing to leverage Docker Compose in BETA can do so using the **Dockge** or **Portainer** apps, available from the [**Community**](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasapps/communityapps/) train, or in a [**Sandbox**](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasapps/sandboxes/).

* Starting in 24.10, TrueNAS does not install a default Nvidia driver.
  This allows for driver updates in between TrueNAS release versions.
  
  A UI selectable option to install/update Nvidia drivers is planned for a future 24.10 development version.
  Users needing Nvidia GPU support in 24.10.BETA.1 can enable this option from a shell session using the command {{< cli >}}midclt call -job docker.update '{"nvidia": true}'{{< /cli >}}.

* Support for the deprecated LDAP **Samba Schema** is removed in 24.10.
  Users with both LDAP and SMB shares configured should migrate legacy Samba domains to Active Directory before upgrading to 24.10.

* Electric Eel introduces redesigns of the UI **Dashboard** and **View Enclosure** screens with numerous improvements to system and enclosure management.
  24.10-BETA-1 includes both the new and legacy screen versions.
  Legacy versions are identified as **(old)** in the navigation menu.

  Removal of the legacy **Dashboard** and **View Enclosure** screens is anticipated in the RC.1 release version.

* SMB audit log entries are omitted by default from the **System > Audit** screen.
  To view SMB audit results, go to **System > Services** and click <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Audit Logs">receipt_long</i> **Audit Logs** for the SMB service or use advanced search on the main **Audit** screen to query SMB events.
  
### Upgrade Paths (Anticipated)

{{< include file="/static/includes/24.10UpgradeMethods.md" >}}

See the <a href="https://www.truenas.com/software-status/" target="_blank">TrueNAS Software Status</a> page for recommendations about which software version to use based on your user type.

Update the system to the latest maintenance release of the installed major version before attempting to upgrade to a new TrueNAS major version.

{{< include file="/static/includes/SCALEUpgradePaths.md" >}}

### TrueNAS Migrations

{{< include file="/_includes/MigrateCOREtoSCALEWarning.md" >}}

{{< enterprise >}}
Enterprise customers with HA systems should contact iXsystems Support for assistance with migrating.
{{< expand "iXsystems Support" "v" >}}
{{< include file="content/_includes/iXsystemsSupportContact.md" >}}
{{< /expand >}}
{{< /enterprise >}}

When attempting to migrate from TrueNAS CORE, the general recommendation is to back up the system configuration file and use an **.iso** file to fresh install TrueNAS.
After install, restore the system configuration and import the pools.

Depending on the specific system configuration, this can be a straightforward or complicated process.
See the [Migration articles]({{< relref "/GettingStarted/Migrate/_index.md" >}}) for cautions and notes about differences between each software and the migration process.

You must either clean install using an <file>iso</file> or use an upgrade file to migrate a TrueNAS 13.0 (or 13.3 for community users) system to 24.10 (Electric Eel).
Enterprise customers should [contact Support](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/gettingstarted/migrate/migratecorehatoscaleha/#expand-1-Enterprise%20HA%20Migrations) for assistance with migrating.

### 24.10-BETA.1 Known Issues

* The **System > Audit** screen can display different values for **Timestamp** in the entries list and **Localtime** in **Event Data**, depending on the local timezone of the system ([NAS-130373](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130373)).
  
* Some users have reported incomplete shutdown and reboot behavior ([NAS-130118](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130118)). This issue has not been reported in iXsystems hardware.

* Unexpected behavior can occur when unlocking a dataset with recursive set to false ([NAS-130329](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130329)). Child datasets with inherited keys are also unlocked with the parent dataset.

* Development of the new TrueCloud backup feature for TrueNAS and Storj integration is ongoing, with fixes for known issues expected in a future 24.10 development version release ([NAS-130320](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130320), [NAS-130794](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130794), and [NAS-130644](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130644)).

* Auto-populated portal group IDs for iSCSI configurations can differ between the **Portals** and **Targets** screen. This is a cosmetic issue in the UI and underlying functionality is not impacted ([NAS-130656](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130656)).

* Audit logging status indicators on SMB share tables might not accurately reflect if logging is or is not enabled on a given share ([NAS-130830](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130830)).

* App icons can periodically fail to render on the **Discover** applications screen, especially when searching for applications ([NAS-130831](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130831)).

* On the virtual machine creation screen, a validation error displays if a configured GPU device is not valid for use in the VM. However, in some cases it can be possible to continue and create the VM with an invalid GPU configuration ([NAS-130754](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130754)). If you receive a GPU validation error during VM creation, remove or correct the invalid GPU before creating the VM.
