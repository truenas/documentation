## 25.04.1

**May 27, 2025**

The TrueNAS team is pleased to release TrueNAS 25.04.1!
This is a maintenance release and includes refinements and fixes for issues discovered after 24.04.0.

### 25.04.1 Notable Changes

{{< enterprise >}}
* Support for account policy settings in TrueNAS Enterprise environments regarding password history, complexity, and aging ([NAS-135115](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135115)).
  Note: Administrators should contact TrueNAS Support before enabling STIG and FIPS security settings (see [Security Settings](/SCALETutorials/SystemSettings/Advanced/#security-settings) for details).
* Add PAM-based session management for middleware ([NAS-127189](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-127189)).
  For STIG compliant environments, the max number of simultaneous logins is 10.
  Accounts are locked for 15 minutes after 3 consecutive failed login attempts.
{{< /enterprise >}}
* Remove support for BOTH in share ACLs ([NAS-135183](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135183)).
* Persist updated GMail OAuth refresh token to prevent deauthentication ([NAS-135394](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135394)).
* Improvements to **Instances**, including:
  * Allow the same host path to be mounted inside multiple containers ([NAS-135371](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135371)).
  * ARC scaling and eviction fixes to prevent VM crashes due to OOM errors ([NAS-135904](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135904)).
  * Enhanced robustness of the **Instances** screen to handle edge-case configurations ([NAS-135098](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135098)).
  * Add a synthetic container root user ([NAS-135375](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135375)).
    This adds a built-in unprivileged root user for containers: **truenas_container_unpriv_root**.
    This account can be used in permissions related APIs / UI forms to grant permissions aligning to root in VMs and containers (see [Managing Instance Permissions](/scaletutorials/instances/#managing-instance-permissions)).
  * Improved error handling when instance ports conflict with other service or application configurations ([NAS-134963](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134963)).
  * Prevent accidental deletion of built-in idmap entries ([NAS-135475](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135475)).
  * Improved validation for attaching and removing zvols from instances ([NAS-135308](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135308)).
* Increase middlewared.service timeout to prevent boot failure when upgrading systems with slow boot drives ([NAS-135663](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135663)).
* Prevent JSON decode crash in smartctl output to fix issues with disk temperature reporting ([NAS-135527](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135527)).
* Fix TrueNAS UI authentication with IPv6 entries in **Allowed IP Addresses** ([NAS-135361](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135361)).
* Fix SSH service startup with auxiliary parameters enabled ([NAS-135367](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135367)).
* Improve human-readable formatting of TrueCloud Backup log ([NAS-134491](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134491)).
* Change how oplocks are handled for multiprotocol shares ([NAS-135040](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135040)).
  Removes kernel oplocks in favor of disabling oplocks on a per-share basis when they have been flagged for mixed-mode use.
  This avoids issues observed in the field with kernel lease breaks causing client timeouts as well allowing SMB leases globally, resolving limitations on multiprotocol shares and Time Machine backup seen in 25.04.0.
* Fix API calls when connected to legacy `/websocket` endpoints ([NAS-135643](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135643)).

### 25.04.1 Known Issues

* Some users of TrueNAS Apps attempting to configure GPU allocation report the error `Expected [uuid] to be set for GPU inslot [<some pci slot>] in [nvidia_gpu_selection])` (see ([NAS-134152](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134152)).

  Users experiencing this error should follow the steps below for a one-time fix that should not need to be repeated.

  Connect to a shell session and retrieve the UUID for each GPU with the command `midclt call app.gpu_choices | jq`.

  For each application that experiences the error, run `midclt call -j app.update APP_NAME '{"values": {"resources": {"gpus": {"use_all_gpus": false, "nvidia_gpu_selection": {"PCI_SLOT": {"use_gpu": true, "uuid": "GPU_UUID"}}}}}}'`
  Where:
  * `APP_NAME` is the name you entered in the application, for example, “plex”.
  * `PCI_SLOT` is the PCI slot identified in the error, for example "0000:2d:00.0”.
  * `GPU_UUID` is the UUID matching the PCI slot that you retrieved with the above command.
* Custom applications with TTY enabled do not display logs in the TrueNAS UI. This is due to an upstream bug, see https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues/1394. Users experiencing this issue can resolve it by either disabling TTY or using `docker logs` from the command line.

{{< include file="/static/includes/25.04FeatureList.md" >}}

### 25.04.0 Notable Changes

Notable changes since 25.04-RC.1:

* Prevent cloned blocks remapping after device removal to avoid data corruption ([NAS-133555](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-133555)).
* Numerous improvements and bug fixes to the experimental **Instances** feature, including:
  * Allow configuration of IO bus for disk devices in Instances ([NAS-134250](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134250)).
    This enables users to create virtualized disks using a standard other than VirtIO in cases where the OS image does not by default include VirtIO drivers.
  * Improved upload speed for volume imports ([NAS-134552](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134552)).
  * New IO Bus configuration options for Virtual Machines ([NAS-134393](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134393)).
  * New IDMAP options for users and groups in Linux containers ([NAS-134447](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134447)).
  * Fixed bug to allow console access for VMs created with an iso file ([NAS-134253](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134253)).
* Fix KeyError crash in ipmi.lan.query ([NAS-134736](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134736)).
* Fix permissions for user app config file ([NAS-134558](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134558)).
* Prevent upgrade failure if encrypted fields are not readable in the DNS auth table ([NAS-134728](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134728)).
* Optimize Dashboard resource widgets and fetch metrics once per page load ([NAS-132124](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-132124)).

### 25.04.0 Known Issues

* The SSH service does not start if certain user-provided SSH auxiliary parameters are configured ([NAS-135367](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135367)).
  This is known to affect `match` parameters minimally, but might impact other parameters as well.

* A validation check intended to prevent users from creating multiple VMs from the same zvol source has the unintended consequence of preventing attaching the same virtual disk to multiple Instance containers ([NAS-135371](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-135371)).

* Some users of TrueNAS Apps attempting to configure GPU allocation report the error `Expected [uuid] to be set for GPU inslot [<some pci slot>] in [nvidia_gpu_selection])` (see ([NAS-134152](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134152)).

  Users experiencing this error should follow the steps below for a one-time fix that should not need to be repeated.

  Where:
  * `APP_NAME` is the name you entered in the application, for example, “plex”.
  * `PCI_SLOT` is the PCI slot identified in the error, for example "0000:2d:00.0”.

**March 11, 2025**

The TrueNAS team is pleased to release TrueNAS 25.04-RC.1!
This release candidate version has software component updates and new features that are in the polishing phase as well as fixes for issues discovered in 25.04-BETA.1.

Special thanks to (Github users) René, jnbastoky, Bas Nijholt, jbsamcho, t0b3, Franco Castillo, Ljcbaby, Oskar, ken1010533, Gleb Chesnokov, markrieder, janekdz, Aurélien Sallé, Nicodemus Schoenwald, m.chernobrov, Jason Cheng, SejoWuigui, TheJulianJES, p0358, Janek, Dhananjay Kamble, wanyuehan, Georg Schölly, dany22m, xream, and Lee Jihaeng for contributing to TrueNAS 25.04-RC.1. For information on how you can contribute, visit https://www.truenas.com/docs/contributing/.

### 25.04-RC.1 Notable Changes

* To prevent excessive resource usage, especially on systems with large HDD storage pools, SMART test results no longer appear directly on the **Storage** dashboard.
  Click **View S.M.A.R.T. Tests** on the **Disk Health** widget to open the **S.M.A.R.T. Test Results of *POOL*** screen.
* To improve stability and prevent unsupported SMB configurations from breaking on [migration from TrueNAS CORE]({{< ref "/GettingStarted/Migrate/" >}}), TrueNAS automatically removes the SMB auxiliary parameters `wide links`, `use sendfile`, `vfs objects`, and `allow insecure` during migration ([NAS-132911](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-132911)).
* To prevent unexpected failures in SMB shares, TrueNAS automatically disables SMB2/3 lease support and AAPL extensions (typically used to configure Time Machine) globally when [multiprotocol SMB/NFS shares]({{< ref "MixedModeShares" >}}) are enabled ([NAS-133680](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-133680)).
* Reserve 2 GiB of disk space (but no more than 1%) to allow the data disk to be replaced with a slightly smaller one in the future ([NAS-134309](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134309)).
* Bugfix: Ensure disk temperature reporting is available for all disks ([NAS-130766](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130766)).
* Bugfix: Allow SMB authentication for usernames with a capital letter ([NAS-134346](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134346)).
* Bugfix: Fix top toolbar icon colors for the iX Blue, Paper, and High Contrast UI themes ([NAS-133853](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-133853)).
* Bugfix: Enable the applications **Web UI** button when accessing from IPv6 or mDNS name ([NAS-133655](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-133655)).

### 25.04-RC.1 Known Issues

* Further development of the experimental **Instances** virtualization feature is expected ahead of the 25.04.0 release. Current known issues include:
  * Full IDMAP support is currently unavailable in the TrueNAS UI ([NAS-134447](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134447)).
    Users testing instances in 25.04-RC.1 can use the **apps** user and group (568:568) to set permissions with consistent mapping in the TrueNAS host and containers.
  * In 25.04-RC.1, VirtIO is the only available IO bus for VMs, which complicates deployment of VMs using OS images that do not natively support VirtIO, see ([NAS-134250](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134250)).
    Additional IO bus options are expected in 25.04.0 ([NAS-134393](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134393)).
* Some users of TrueNAS Apps attempting to configure GPU allocation report the error `Expected [uuid] to be set for GPU inslot [<some pci slot>] in [nvidia_gpu_selection])` (see ([NAS-134152](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134152)).

  Users experiencing this error should follow the steps below for a one-time fix that should not need to be repeated.

  Connect to a shell session and retrieve the UUID for each GPU with the command `midclt call app.gpu_choices | jq`.

  For each application that experiences the error, run `midclt call -j app.update APP_NAME '{"values": {"resources": {"gpus": {"use_all_gpus": false, "nvidia_gpu_selection": {"PCI_SLOT": {"use_gpu": true, "uuid": "GPU_UUID"}}}}}}'`
  Where:
    * `APP_NAME` is the name you entered in the application, for example, “plex”.
    * `PCI_SLOT` is the PCI slot identified in the error, for example "0000:2d:00.0”.
    * `GPU_UUID` is the UUID matching the PCI slot that you retrieved with the above command.

{{< include file="/static/includes/JiraFilterInstructions.md" >}}

### 25.04-BETA.1 Known Issues

* An issue has been discovered for cloud sync tasks configured with file name encryption, which is available in **Advanced Remote Options** ([NAS-132472](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-132472)). As this is an upstream issue in rclone, we recommend that users should not create new cloud sync tasks with the **Filename Encryption** setting enabled. Existing users of this feature must leave it enabled for existing cloud sync tasks to be able to recover backups.
* Unable to Create dataset under disks while configuring a new virtualization Instance ([NAS-134151](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134151)).
* UUID related traceback when activating NVIDIA GPU for Jellyfin app: `base_v2_1_14.error.RenderError: Expected [uuid] to be set for GPU in slot [0000:01:00.0] in [nvidia_gpu_selection]` ([NAS-134152](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134152)).

  Users experiencing this error should follow the steps below for a one-time fix that should not need to be repeated.

  Connect to a shell session and retrieve the UUID for each GPU with the command `midclt call app.gpu_choices | jq`.

  For each application that experiences the error, run `midclt call -j app.update APP_NAME '{"values": {"resources": {"gpus": {"use_all_gpus": false, "nvidia_gpu_selection": {"PCI_SLOT": {"use_gpu": true, "uuid": "GPU_UUID"}}}}}}'`
  Where:
    * `APP_NAME` is the name you entered in the application, for example, “plex”.
    * `PCI_SLOT` is the PCI slot identified in the error, for example "0000:2d:00.0”.
    * `GPU_UUID` is the UUID matching the PCI slot that you retrieved with the above command.
