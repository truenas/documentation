## Upgrade Notes

{{< include file="/static/includes/UpgradeClearCache.md" >}}

* TrueNAS SCALE is an appliance built from specific Linux packages.
  Attempting to update SCALE with `apt` or methods other than the SCALE web interface can result in a nonfunctional system.

* Users with unofficial apps installed should review app storage drivers to determine if any utilize the OpenEBS-ZFS container storage interface (CSI) before upgrading. This CSI is not supported in TrueNAS SCALE 24.04 ([Removal Notice](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/openebs-zfs-driver-removal-notice.115026/)). Unofficial apps that use OpenEBS-ZFS CSI drivers should maintain functionality for existing deployments, but users are not able to make backups or restore any existing backups for those apps. New users are not able to install and deploy these apps.

* All auxiliary parameters can experience changes between TrueNAS major versions due to security and development changes.
  We recommend removing all auxiliary parameters from TrueNAS configurations before upgrading as these settings can result in SMB share failures after an upgrade.

* TrueNAS SCALE 24.04 (Dragonfish) no longer includes the deprecated gluster component.
  Systems installed with 24.04 cannot be used in experimental TrueCommand clusters.
  Community users that experimented with this now-deprecated TrueCommand feature need to migrate any data from the TrueCommand cluster and delete it before upgrading any clustered SCALE systems to 24.04.

* Several built-in services from SCALE 22.12 (Bluefin) in **System Settings > Services** are replaced by community applications ([details](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/22.12/gettingstarted/scaledeprecatedfeatures/)).
  SCALE 22.12 (Bluefin) systems must disable these built-in services and begin using the equivalent application **before** upgrading to SCALE 23.10 (Cobia), before upgrading to SCALE 24.04, or users can force an upgrade without disabling them. This is not recommended for the S3 service as you must migrate the MinIO service and data or lose it.

* {{< include file="/static/includes/24.04HomeDirectory.md" >}}
  
  See [Managing Users]({{< relref "managelocalusersscale.md#configuring-a-user" >}}) for more information.

* Users upgrading from TrueNAS SCALE 23.10 (Cobia) to 24.04 (Dragonfish) who import a Cobia configuration file might find that some services are not automatically enabled as expected.
After uploading the configuration file and rebooting the system, review **System Settings > Services**.
For any services that should be enabled, set it to **Running** and **Start Automatically**.

### Upgrade Paths

There are a variety of options for upgrading to SCALE 24.04.

{{< include file="/static/includes/24.04UpgradeMethods.md" >}}

See the <a href="https://www.truenas.com/software-status/" target="_blank">TrueNAS Software Status</a> page for recommendations about which software version to use based on your user type.

Update the system to the latest maintenance release of the installed major version before attempting to upgrade to a new TrueNAS SCALE major version.

{{< include file="/static/includes/SCALEUpgradePaths.md" >}}

### CORE > SCALE Migrations

{{< include file="/static/includes/MigrateCOREtoSCALEWarning.md" >}}

{{< enterprise >}}
Enterprise customers with HA systems should contact iXsystems Support for assistance with migrating to TrueNAS SCALE.
{{< expand "iXsystems Support" "v" >}}
{{< include file="/static/includes/iXsystemsSupportContact.md" >}}
{{< /expand >}}
{{< /enterprise >}}

When attempting to migrate from TrueNAS CORE, the general recommendation is to back up the system configuration file and use a SCALE **.iso** file to fresh install TrueNAS.
After install, restore the system configuration and import the pools.

Depending on the specific system configuration, this can be a straightforward or complicated process.
See the [Migration articles]({{< relref "/GettingStarted/Migrate/_index.md" >}}) for cautions and notes about differences between each software and the CORE to SCALE migration process.

You must either clean install or use an upgrade ***iso** file to migrate a TrueNAS CORE system to SCALE 24.04 (Dragonfish).
Enterprise customers should [contact Support](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/gettingstarted/migrate/migratecorehatoscaleha/#expand-1-Enterprise%20HA%20Migrations) for assistance with transitioning from CORE to SCALE.

### 24.04.2 Known Issues

* Systems migrating from 13.0-U6.2 that have storage pools with cache and spare devices can show, post-upgrade to 24.04.2, pools as having unavailable devices and other disk detection errors ([NAS-130825](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130825)).
  This is caused by a difference between how CORE and SCALE identify devices for pool import. To work around this issue, use the TrueNAS UI to export the affected pool and then re-import it.

* Network UPS Tools (NUT) service can utilize 100% of 1 CPU thread when power is cut to the UPS [NAS-130175](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130175).
  This issue is resolved in a new version of the related service, which will be made available in a future TrueNAS release when the [updated NUT version](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/nut) is moved into upstream stable Debian repositories.

### 24.04.0 Known Issues

* An issue was discovered after 24.04.0 released involving ZFS ARC memory and excessive swap space usage.
  Community members who have experienced this issue report excessive RAM consumption leading to decreased middleware performance, web UI slowdowns, and UI inaccessibility.

  24.04.0 users experiencing system slowdown and excess swap space usage (especially when free RAM is still available) can temporarily disable swap from the command line by running `swapoff -a` as root (or sudo). See [Investigation of slow UI / RAM / SWAP issues](https://forums.truenas.com/t/investigation-of-slow-ui-ram-swap-issues/4029) on the TrueNAS Community Forums for more information and further discussion.

  A resolution is expected in the upcoming 24.04.1 maintenance release.

* A TrueNAS system that has a VM configured with IPv6 bind addresses can disrupt the TrueNAS web interface after upgrading to 24.04.0 ([NAS-128102](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-128102)).
  Users with this particular configuration are encouraged to either wait for the 24.04.1 maintenance release before upgrading or remove any IPv6 bind addresses from existing VMs before upgrading to 24.04.0.

* Installed Apps network traffic is reporting numbers greater than actual usage [NAS-128471](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-128471).

### 24.04-RC.1 Known Issues

* Users upgrading from TrueNAS SCALE 23.10 (Cobia) to 24.04 (Dragonfish) who import a Cobia configuration file might find that some services are not automatically enabled as expected.
After uploading the configuration file and rebooting the system, review **System Settings > Services**.
For services that should be enabled, set it to **Running** and **Start Automatically**.
* System data reporting graphs on the **Dashboard** and **Reporting** screens are undergoing additional review and polish ahead of the 24.04.0 release.

**February 6, 2024**

iXsystems is pleased to release TrueNAS SCALE 24.04-BETA.1!
This has software component updates and new features that are in the polishing phase.

Notable changes:

* New audit logging framework added with initial support for SMB and other TrueNAS UI account and authorization activity ([NAS-123447](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-123447)), including SMB activity ([NAS-123371](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-123371)).
  An [Auditing screen]({{< relref "AuditingSCALE.md" >}}) manages this feature in the UI.

* A new dashboard widget for backup configurations is available. This summarizes saved backup tasks and has links to quickly set up new backup schedules.

* New status pages for [SMB]({{< relref "SMBSharesScreens.md#smb-status-screens" >}}) and [NFS]({{< relref "NFSSharesScreens.md#nfs-sessions-screen" >}}) services allow managing active sessions ([SMB - NAS-105505](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-105505) and [NFS - NAS-124942](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-124942)).

* FreeIPA support is added to **Credentials** > **Directory Services** > **Configure LDAP** form ([NAS-123701](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-123701)).

* The [Feedback reporting]({{< relref "/SCALEUIReference/TopToolbar/_index.md#how-would-you-rate-this-page" >}}) window has improved!
  The page rating icon is now always visible on the top toolbar and the feedback window also functions for new bug reports and improvement suggestions ([NAS-124484](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-124484)).
  Clicking **File a ticket** on **System Settings** > **General** also opens the feedback window.
  
* An unsupported [development mode]({{< relref "DeveloperMode.md" >}}) is added to the base system.
  Enabling this puts the system in an unsupported state and allows customization of the operating system.
  
* systemd-nspawn containers ([Sandboxes]({{< relref "/SCALETutorials/Apps/Sandboxes.md" >}})) are added as an unsupported community feature so that an advanced containerization user can deploy custom software in persistent containers.

* Support is added for data ingest via filesystem (SMB/NFS) clients, allowing users migrating to TrueNAS SCALE to more easily import data from a third-party NAS solution ([NAS-123717](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-123717)).
  Supported SMB migration via the TrueNAS Syncthing Enterprise app is arriving in a future 24.04 release.

* Linux kernel is updated to 6.6 ([NAS-123465](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-123465)).

* ZFS ARC memory allocations are now identical to TrueNAS CORE ([NAS-123034](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-123034)).

* Share creation forms are reworked to centralize and speed up the configuration process ([NAS-123420](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-123420)).

* The feedback system is reworked and expanded to also control creating bug reports and improvement suggestions in the TrueNAS Jira project ([NAS-124484](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-124484)).

* The deprecated gluster component is removed and all other gluster-related components are removed from TrueNAS SCALE.

* OpenEBS-ZFS container storage interface (CSI) driver support is removed in TrueNAS SCALE 24.04 ([Removal Notice](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/openebs-zfs-driver-removal-notice.115026/)).
  
  New and existing users who only use official apps are unaffected by this change, as these apps do not use OpenEBS-ZFS CSI drivers.
  Unofficial apps are unaffected if they are configured as outlined below.
  
  Unofficial apps that use OpenEBS-ZFS CSI drivers should maintain functionality for existing deployments, but users are not able to make backups or restore any existing backups for those apps. New users are not able to install and deploy these apps.
  
  Maintainers of unofficial catalog apps using OpenEBS-ZFS CSI drivers should either begin to ship a CSI driver with the app or use the one provided in SCALE.
  
* Improved performance for SMB Shares with directories containing [large file counts](https://www.truenas.com/docs/references/performance/smbfiletimes/).

### 24.04-BETA.1 Known Issues

* The administrator account privileges feature is still under development and further bugfixes and enhancements are anticipated in future 24.04 (Dragonfish) releases.
  Issues that are currently being resolved as part of finishing the feature:
  * Read-only TrueNAS administrators are not able to query audit entries. This [fix](https://github.com/truenas/middleware/pull/13035) is anticipated in the 24.04-RC.1 release.

* Displayed units for network traffic are inconsistent between the web interface Dashboard and Reporting screens.
  Additional changes for consistency and IEC conformant terminology are targeted for 24.04-RC.1 [NAS-125453](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-125453).
