### Migrating from TrueNAS CORE

{{< include file="/_includes/MigrateCOREtoSCALEWarning.md" >}}

{{< enterprise >}}
Enterprise customers with HA systems should contact TrueNAS Enterprise Support for assistance with migrating to TrueNAS.
{{< expand "TrueNAS Enterprise Support" "v" >}}
{{< include file="content/_includes/iXsystemsSupportContact.md" >}}
{{< /expand >}}
{{< /enterprise >}}

When attempting to migrate from a FreeBSD-based TrueNAS version, the general recommendation is to back up the system configuration file and use a TrueNAS **.iso** file to fresh install TrueNAS.
After install, restore the system configuration and import the pools.

Depending on the specific system configuration, this can be a straightforward or complicated process.
See the [Migration articles]({{< relref "/GettingStarted/Migrate/_index.md" >}}) for cautions and notes about differences between each software and the migration process.

You must either clean install using an <file>iso</file> or use an upgrade file to migrate a FreeBSD-based TrueNAS system to TrueNAS 25.04 (Fangtooth).
Enterprise customers should [contact Support](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/gettingstarted/migrate/migratecorehatoscaleha/#expand-1-Enterprise%20HA%20Migrations) for assistance with migration.

{{< /hint >}}

**March 11, 2025**

The TrueNAS team is pleased to release TrueNAS 25.04-RC.1!
This release candidate version has software component updates and new features that are in the polishing phase as well as fixes for issues discovered in 25.04-BETA.1.

Special thanks to (Github users) René, jnbastoky, Bas Nijholt, jbsamcho, t0b3, Franco Castillo, Ljcbaby, Oskar, ken1010533, Gleb Chesnokov, markrieder, janekdz, Aurélien Sallé, Nicodemus Schoenwald, m.chernobrov, Jason Cheng, SejoWuigui, TheJulianJES, p0358, Janek, Dhananjay Kamble, wanyuehan, Georg Schölly, dany22m, xream, and Lee Jihaeng for contributing to TrueNAS 25.04-RC.1. For information on how you can contribute, visit https://www.truenas.com/docs/contributing/.

### Notable Changes

* To prevent excessive resource usage, especially on systems with large HDD storage pools, SMART test results no longer appear directly on the **Storage** dashboard.
  Click **View S.M.A.R.T. Tests** on the **Disk Health** widget to open the **S.M.A.R.T. Test Results of *POOL*** screen.
* Allow configuration of IO bus for disk devices in Instances ([NAS-134250](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134250)).
  This enables users to create virtualized disks using a standard other than VirtIO in cases where the OS image does not by default include VirtIO drivers.
* To improve stability and prevent unsupported SMB configurations from breaking on [migration from TrueNAS CORE]({{< relref "/GettingStarted/Migrate/_index.md" >}}), TrueNAS automatically removes the SMB auxiliary parameters `wide links`, `use sendfile`, `vfs objects`, and `allow insecure` during migration ([NAS-132911](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-132911)).
* To prevent unexpected failures in SMB shares, TrueNAS automatically disables SMB2/3 lease support globally when [multiprotocol SMB/NFS shares]({{< relref "MixedModeShares.md" >}}) are enabled ([NAS-133680](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-133680)).
* Reserve 2 GiB of disk space (but no more than 1%) to allow the data disk to be replaced with a slightly smaller one in the future ([NAS-134309](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134309)).
* Bugfix: Ensure disk temperature reporting is available for all disks ([NAS-130766](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130766)).
* Bugfix: Allow SMB authentication for usernames with a capital letter ([NAS-134346](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134346)).
* Bugfix: Fix top toolbar icon colors for the iX Blue, Paper, and High Contrast UI themes ([NAS-133853](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-133853)).
* Bugfix: Enable the applications **Web UI** button when accessing from IPv6 or mDNS name ([NAS-133655](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-133655)).

### Known Issues

* Further development of the experimental **Instances** virtualization feature is expected ahead of the 25.04.0 release. Current known issues include:
  * Full IDMAP support is currently unavailable in the TrueNAS UI ([NAS-134447](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134447)).
    Users testing instances in 25.04-RC.1 can use the **apps** user and group (568:568) to set permissions with consistent mapping in the TrueNAS host and containers.
  * In 25.04-RC.1, VirtIO is the only available IO bus for VMs, which complicates deployment of VMs using OS images that do not natively support VirtIO, see ([NAS-134250](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134250)).
    Additional IO bus options are expected in 25.04.0 ([NAS-134393](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134393)).
* Some users of TrueNAS Apps attempting to configure GPU allocation report the error `Expected [uuid] to be set for GPU inslot [<some pci slot>] in [nvidia_gpu_selection])` (see ([NAS-134152](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134152)).

  Users experiencing this error should follow the steps below for a one time fix that should not need to be repeated.

  Connect to a shell session and retrieve the UUID for each GPU with the command `midclt call app.gpu_choices | jq`.

  For each application that experiences the error, run `midclt call -job app.update APP_NAME '{"values": {"resources": {"gpus": {"use_all_gpus": false, "nvidia_gpu_selection": {"PCI_SLOT": {"use_gpu": true, "uuid": "GPU_UUID"}}}}}}'`
  Where:
    * `APP_NAME` is the name you entered in the application, for example “plex”.
    * `PCI_SLOT` is the pci slot identified in the error, for example "0000:2d:00.0”.
    * `GPU_UUID` is the UUID matching the pci slot that you retrieved with the above command.

**February 13, 2025**

The TrueNAS team is pleased to release TrueNAS 25.04-BETA.1!
This first public release version of TrueNAS 25.04 (Fangtooth) has software component updates and new features that are in the polishing phase.

### Notable changes

* The TrueNAS REST API is deprecated in TrueNAS 25.04 and replaced with a versioned JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket API ([API Reference]({{< relref "/api/_index.md" >}})). Full removal of the REST API is planned for a future release.
* Improved API key mechanism with support for user-linked API keys ([NAS-131396](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-131396)).
* UI login experience improvements ([NAS-130810](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130810)).
* NFS over RDMA support - Enterprise Feature ([NAS-131784](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-131784)).
* iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER) support - Enterprise Feature ([NAS-106190](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-106190)).
* ZFS Fast deduplication support ([NAS-127088](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-127088)).
* iSCSI XCOPY support through ZVOL block cloning ([NAS-130017](ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130017)).
* Incus Container & VM Support - Experimental Community Feature ([NAS-130251](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130251)).
* Hide SED related options in the UI for non-Enterprise users ([NAS-133442](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-133442)).
* Bump nvidia driver version ([NAS-133575](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-133575)).
* Remove integrated Netdata web portal from the TrueNAS UI and middleware ([NAS-133629](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-133629)).
  Default Netdata integration is removed due to STIG security requirements.
  Users who want to continue using Netdata monitoring can install Netdata from the TrueNAS Apps catalog.
* Bugfix: "Cache and Spare disks are not recognized post upgrade from 13.0 U6.2 to 24.04.2" ([NAS-130825](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-130825)).
* Bugfix: "Unable to start a VM due to insufficient memory" ([NAS-128544](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-128544)).

### Known Issues

* An issue has been discovered for cloud sync tasks configured with file name encryption, which is available in **Advanced Remote Options** ([NAS-132472](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-132472)). As this is an upstream issue in rclone, we recommend that users should not create new cloud sync tasks with the **Filename Encryption** setting enabled. Existing users of this feature must leave it enabled for existing cloud sync tasks to be able to recover backups.
* Unable to Create dataset under disks while configuring a new virtualization Instance ([NAS-134151](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134151)).
* UUID related traceback when activating NVIDIA GPU for Jellyfin app: `base_v2_1_14.error.RenderError: Expected [uuid] to be set for GPU in slot [0000:01:00.0] in [nvidia_gpu_selection]` ([NAS-134152](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-134152)).

  Users experiencing this error should follow the steps below for a one time fix that should not need to be repeated.

  Connect to a shell session and retrieve the UUID for each GPU with the command `midclt call app.gpu_choices | jq`.

  For each application that experiences the error, run `midclt call -job app.update APP_NAME '{"values": {"resources": {"gpus": {"use_all_gpus": false, "nvidia_gpu_selection": {"PCI_SLOT": {"use_gpu": true, "uuid": "GPU_UUID"}}}}}}'`
  Where:
    * `APP_NAME` is the name you entered in the application, for example “plex”.
    * `PCI_SLOT` is the pci slot identified in the error, for example "0000:2d:00.0”.
    * `GPU_UUID` is the UUID matching the pci slot that you retrieved with the above command.
