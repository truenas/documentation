This section provides information and instructions for TrueNAS CORE users wanting to migrate to SCALE.

{{< include file="/static/includes/MigrateCOREtoSCALE24_04.md" >}}

Linux treats device names differently than FreeBSD so please read [Component Naming]({{< relref "ComponentNaming.md" >}}) for more information.

After migration, review each area of the UI that was previously configured in CORE.
