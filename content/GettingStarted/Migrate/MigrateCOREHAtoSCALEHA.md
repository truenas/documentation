**TrueNAS Enterprise customers should consult with iXsystems Support before attempting migrate to TrueNAS SCALE.**

The process requires:
* Backing up critical data.
* An extended maintenance window.
* Executing the migration process in a precise order.
* Additional system configuration to update network interfaces and add new administrator accounts.

Review the [Migration Preparation article]({{< ref "MigratePrep" >}}) to see detailed notes and caveats about the migration process.
