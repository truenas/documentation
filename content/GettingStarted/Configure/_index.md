This section provides instructions for users that are configuring TrueNAS SCALE for the first time.

{{< enterprise >}}
TrueNAS SCALE Enterprise customers should contact iXsystems Support for assistance with the initial set up and configuration of their systems.

{{< /expand >}}
{{< /enterprise >}}

After completing the installation process, you can either use the [Console setup menu]({{< relref "ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.md" >}}) to reconfigure the primary network interface with a static IP address or use the SCALE UI to make network changes and complete the initial configuration.

Configuring your system includes:

* Setting up your first pool
* Setting up data sharing
* Setting up backup for the system and your stored data
