Idmap settings exist for the purpose of integration with an existing directory domain to ensure that UIDs and GIDs assigned to Active Directory users and groups have consistent values domain-wide.
The correct configuration therefore relies on details that are entirely external to the TrueNAS server, e.g., how the AD administrator has configured other Unix-like computers in the environment.

The default is to use an algorithmic method of generating IDs based on the RID component of the user or group SID in Active Directory.

{{< hint type=important >}}
Only administrators experienced with configuring Id mapping should attempt to add new or edit existing idmaps.
Misconfiguration can lead to permissions incorrectly assigned to users or groups in the case where data is transferred to/from external servers via ZFS replication or rsync (or when access is performed via NFS or other protocols that directly access the UIDs/GIDs on files).

The **Idmap** directory service lets users configure and select a backend to map Windows security identifiers (SIDs) to UNIX UIDs and GIDs. Users must enable the **Active Directory** service to configure and use identity mapping (Idmap).

Users can click **Add** in the **Idmap** widget to configure backends or click on an already existing Idmap to edit it.

TrueNAS automatically generates an Idmap after you configure AD or LDAP.
