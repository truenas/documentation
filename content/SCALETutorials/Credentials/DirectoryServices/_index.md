The TrueNAS Directory Services tutorials contain options to edit directory domain and account settings, set up ID mapping, and configure authentication and authorization services in TrueNAS.

## About Directory Services

TrueNAS provides unified directory services configuration that supports connecting to Active Directory domains or LDAP servers through a single, streamlined interface. The directory services configuration screen allows you to set up authentication credentials, connection parameters, and advanced options in one location.

Only one directory service type can be configured and enabled at a time.
To view Idmap and Kerberos Services, click **Show** next to **Advanced Settings**.
