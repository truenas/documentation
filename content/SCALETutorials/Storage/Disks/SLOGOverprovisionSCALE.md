Over-provisioning an SSD distributes the total number of writes and erases across more flash blocks on the drive.
Seagate provides a thoughtful investigation into over-provisioning SSDs here:
https://www.seagate.com/blog/ssd-over-provisioning-benefits-master-ti/.

For more general information on SLOG disks, see [SLOG Devices](https://www.truenas.com/docs/references/slog/).

Because this is a potentially disruptive procedure, contact iXsystems Support to review your overprovisioning needs and schedule a maintenance window.
