## Managing Devices
After creating a VM, the next step is to add virtual devices for that VM.
Using the Create Virtual Machine wizard configures at least one disk, NIC, and the display as part of the process.
To add devices, from the **Virtual Machines** screen, click anywhere on a VM entry to expand it and show the options for the VM.

Click <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Devices">device_hub</i> **Devices** to open the **Devices** screen for the VM.
From this screen, you can edit, add, or delete devices.
Click the <span class="material-icons">more_vert</span> icon at the right of each listed device to see device options.

The devices for the VM display as a list.

Device notes:

* A virtual machine attempts to boot from devices according to the **Device Order**, starting with **1000**, then ascending.
* A **CD-ROM** device allows booting a VM from a CD-ROM image like an installation CD.
  The CD image must be available in the system storage.
* With a **Display** device, remote clients can connect to VM display sessions using a SPICE client, or by installing a 3rd party remote desktop server inside your VM.
  SPICE clients are available from the [SPICE Protocol site](https://www.spice-space.org/).

Before adding, editing, or deleting a VM device, stop the VM if it is running.
Click the **State** toggle to stop or restart a VM, or use the **Stop** and **Restart** buttons.

### Editing a Device
Select **Edit** to open the **Edit Device** screen.
You can change the type of virtual hard disk, the storage volume to use, or change the device boot order.

To edit a VM device:
1. Stop the VM if it is running, then click **Devices** to open the list of devices for the selected VM.
2. Click on the <span class="material-icons">more_vert</span> icon at the right of the listed device you want to edit, then select **Edit** to open the **Edit Device** screen.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/EditDeviceDiskScreen.png" alt="Edit Device VM Disk" id="Edit Device VM Disk" >}}

3. Select the path to the zvol created when setting up the VM on the **Zvol** dropdown list.
4. Select the type of hard disk emulation from the **Mode** dropdown list.
   Select **AHCI** for better software compatibility, or select **VirtIO** for better performance if the guest OS installed in the VM has support for VirtIO disk devices.
5. (Optional) Specify the disk sector size in bytes in **Disk Sector Size**.
   Leave set to **Default** or select either **512** or **4096** byte values from the dropdown list.
   If not set, the sector size uses the ZFS volume values.
6. Specify the boot order or priority level in **Device Order** to move this device up or down in the sequence.
   The lower the number the higher the priority in the boot sequence.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Restart the VM.

### Deleting a Disk Device
Deleting a device removes it from the list of available devices for the selected VM.

To delete a VM device:
1. Stop the VM if it is running, then click **Devices** to open the list of devices for the selected VM.
2. Click on the <span class="material-icons">more_vert</span> icon at the right of the listed device you want to edit, then select **Delete**.
   The **Delete Virtual Machine** dialog opens.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/DeleteVirtualMachine.png" alt="Delete Virtual Machine" id="Delete Virtual Machine" >}}

3. Select **Delete zvol device** to confirm you want to delete the zvol device.
   Select **Force Delete** if you want the system to force the deletion of the zvol device, even if other devices or services are using or affiliated with the zvol device.
4. Click **Delete Device**.

### Changing the Device Order
1. Stop the VM if it is running, then click **Devices** to open the list of devices for the selected VM
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Enter the number that represents where in the boot sequence you want this device to boot in the **Devices Order** field.
   The lower the number, the higher the device is in the boot sequence.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Restart the VM.

### Adding a CD-ROM Device
Select **CD-ROM** as the **Device Type** on the **Add Device** screen and set a boot order.

2. Click **Add** and select **CD-ROM** from the **Device Type** dropdown list.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/VMAddDeviceCDROM.png" alt="Devices Add CD-ROM Type" id="Devices Add CD-ROM Type" >}}

3. Specify the mount path.
   Click on the <i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> to the left of **/mnt** and at the pool and dataset levels to expand the directory tree. Select the path to the CD-ROM device.
4. Specify the boot sequence in **Device Order**.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Restart the VM.

### Adding a NIC Device Type
Select **NIC** in the **Device Type** on the **Add Device** screen to add a network interface card for the VM to use.

1. Stop the VM if it is running, then click **Devices**.
2. Click **Add** and select **NIC** from the **Device Type** dropdown list.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/VMAddDeviceNIC.png" alt="Devices Add NIC" id="Devices Add NIC" >}}

3. Select the adapter type. Choose **Intel e82585(e1000)** for maximum compatibility with most operating systems.
   If the guest OS supports VirtIO paravirtualized network drivers, choose **VirtIO** for better performance.
4. Click **Generate** to assign a new random MAC address to replace the random default address, or enter your own custom address.
5. Select the physical interface you want to use from the **NIC To Attach** dropdown list.
6. (Optional) Select **Trust Guest Filters** to allow the virtual server to change its MAC address and join multicast groups.
   This is required for the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).

   Setting this attribute has security risks.
   It allows the virtual server to change its MAC address and receive all frames delivered to this address.
   Determine your network setup needs before setting this attribute.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Restart the VM
