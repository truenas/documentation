The Data Protection section allows users to set up multiple redundant tasks that will protect and/or backup data in case of drive failure.

Scrub Tasks can provide early disk failure alerts by identifying data integrity problems and detecting various indicators of drive reliability.

TrueCloud Backup, Cloud Sync, Periodic Snapshot, Rsync, and Replication Tasks, provide backup storage for data and allow users to revert the system to a previous configuration or point in time.
