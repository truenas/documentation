When TrueNAS performs a scrub, ZFS scans the data on a pool.
Scrubs identify data integrity problems, detect silent data corruptions caused by transient hardware issues, and provide early disk failure alerts.

## Default Scrub Tasks
TrueNAS generates a default scrub task when you create a new pool and sets it to run every Sunday at 12:00 AM.

## Creating New Scrub Tasks
TrueNAS needs at least one data [pool]({{< relref "/SCALEUIReference/Storage/_index.md" >}}) to create scrub task.

To create a scrub task for a pool, go to **Data Protection** and click **ADD** in the **Scrub Tasks** window.

Select a preset schedule from the dropdown list or click **Custom** to create a new schedule for when to run a scrub task. **Custom** opens the **Advanced Scheduler** window.

{{< /expand >}}

To view the progress of a scrub task, check the status under the **Next Run** column.

## Editing Scrub Tasks
To edit a scrub, go to **Data Protection** and click the scrub task to edit.
