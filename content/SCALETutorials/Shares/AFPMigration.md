Since the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) for shares is deprecated and no longer receives updates, it is not in TrueNAS SCALE.

However, users can sidegrade a TrueNAS CORE configuration into SCALE, so TrueNAS SCALE migrates previously-saved AFP configurations into SMB configurations.

## Migrating AFP Shares

To prevent data corruption that could result from the sidegrade operation, in TrueNAS SCALE, go to **Windows (SMB) Shares**, select the <span class="material-icons">more_vert</span> for the share, then select **Edit** to open the **Edit SMB** screen.
Click **Advanced Options** and scroll down to the **Other Options** section.
Select **Legacy AFP Compatibility** to enable compatibility for AFP shares migrated to SMB shares.
Do not select this option if you want a pure SMB share with no AFP relation.

{{< hint type=important >}}
Netatalk service is no longer in SCALE as of version 21.06.
AFP shares automatically migrate to SMB shares with the **Legacy AFP Compatibility** option enabled.
Do not clear the **Legacy AFP Compatibility** checkbox, as it impacts how data is written to and read from shares.
Any other shares created to access these paths after the migration must also have **Legacy AFP Compatibility** selected.
{{< /hint >}}

Once you have [sidegraded from CORE to SCALE]({{< relref "MigratingFromCore.md" >}}), you can find your migrated AFP configuration in **Shares >** **Windows Shares (SMB)** with the prefix **AFP_**.
To make the migrated AFP share accessible, start the SMB service.

## Connecting Migrated Shares

Since AFP shares migrate to SMB in SCALE, you must use SMB syntax to mount them.

On your Apple system, press <kbd><span class="iconify" data-icon="material-symbols:keyboard-command-key"></span>+K</kbd> or go to **Go > Connect to Server...**.

Enter smb://*ipaddress*/mnt/*pool*/*dataset*, where:

* ipaddress* is your TrueNAS IP address
* *pool* is the name of the pool
* *dataset* is the name of the shared dataset
