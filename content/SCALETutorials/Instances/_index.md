{{< include file="/static/includes/25.04Virtualization.md" >}}

**Instances** allow users to configure Incus-based containers or VMs in TrueNAS.

*Linux containers*, powered by LXC, offer a lightweight, isolated environment that shares the host system kernel while maintaining its own file system, processes, and network settings.
Containers start quickly, use fewer system resources than VMs, and scale efficiently, making them ideal for deploying and managing scalable applications with minimal overhead.

*Virtual machines (VMs)*, powered by QEMU, offer full OS isolation, kernel independence, and can run diverse OS types.
VMs emulate hardware, providing greater isolation than containers but requiring more system resources, making them ideal for legacy applications, full-featured desktops, or software with strict OS dependencies.

## Setting Up the Instances Service

You must choose a pool before you can deploy an instance.
The **Instances** screen header displays a <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Pool is not selected** status before a pool for instances is selected.
See [Choosing the Instances Pool](#choosing-the-instances-pool) below for more information about pool selection.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/InstancesPoolNotSelected.png" alt="Pool Is Not Selected" id="Pool Is Not Selected" >}}

After setting the pool, <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" title="Check"></i> **Initialized** shows on the screen header.

For more information on screens and screen functions, refer to the UI Reference article on [Instances Screens]({{< ref "/SCALEUIReference/InstancesScreens" >}}).

Use the **Configuration** dropdown to access the **[Global Settings](#configuring-global-settings)**, **[Manage Volumes](#managing-volumes)**, and [**Map User/Group IDs**](#mapping-user-and-group-ids) options.

### Configuring Global Settings

Click **Global Settings** on the **Configuration** menu to open the **Global Settings** screen, showing global options that apply to all instances.
Use these options to configure the [storage pool](#choosing-the-instances-pool) for instances and [network settings](#configuring-the-default-network).

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/InstancesGlobalSettingsScreen.png" alt="Global Settings Screen" id="Global Settings Screen" >}}

#### Choosing the Instances Pool

You must set the pool before you can add any instances.

Use the use the **Pool** dropdown to select the pool and click **Save**.

We recommend users keep the VM and container use case in mind when choosing an instances pool.
Select a pool with enough storage space for all the instances you intend to host.

For stability and performance, we recommend using SSD/NVMe storage for the instances pool due to their faster speed and resilience for repeated read/writes.

<!-- Placeholder: Further description of the instances storage implementation here (once implementation is nailed down and experimental status removed) -->

To select a different pool for instances to use, use the **Pool** dropdown to select a different pool.
Select **[Disabled]** to deactivate the pool and disable the instances service.

#### Configuring the Default Network

Use the **Default Network** settings on the **Global Settings** screen to define how instances connect to the network.
These settings apply to all new containers and VMs, unless configured otherwise.  

Select **Automatic** from the **Bridge** dropdown list to use the default network bridge for communication between instances and the TrueNAS host.
To specify an existing bridge, select one from the dropdown list.
See [Accessing NAS from VMs and Containers]({{< ref "/ScaleTutorials/Network/ContainerNASBridge" >}}) for details.  
When **Bridge** is set to **Automatic**, the **IPv4 Network** and **IPv6 Network** settings display.

Enter an IPv4 address and subnet (e.g., *192.168.1.0/24*) in **IPv4 Network** to assign a specific network for instances.
Leave this field empty to allow TrueNAS to assign the default address.  

Enter an IPv6 address and subnet (e.g., *fd42:96dd:aef2:483c::1/64*) in **IPv6 Network** or leave this field empty to allow TrueNAS to assign the default address.  

Adjust these settings as needed to match your network environment and ensure proper connectivity for instances.  

### Managing Volumes

Click **Manage Volumes** on the **Configuration** menu to open the **Volumes** screen, which lists all the volumes currently configured for the instances service.

Click **Create Volume** to open the [**Create New Volume**](#creating-volumes) dialog to configure a new instances volume.

Click **Import Zvols** to open the [**Import Zvol**](#importing-zvols) dialog to import an existing Zvol as an instances volume.

Click **Upload ISO** to open a file browser to select an <file>.iso</file> file from the client computer and [upload it](#uploading-iso-images) to TrueNAS for use in instances.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/InstancesVolumesScreen.png" alt="Volumes Screen" id="Volumes Screen" >}}

#### Creating Volumes

Click **Create Volume** on the **Volumes** screen to open the **Create New Volume** dialog.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/InstancesCreateVolume.png" alt="Create New Volume Dialog" id="Create New Volume Dialog" >}}

Enter a name for the volume.

Enter a size for the volume, for example *1 GiB*.

Click **Create** to create the new volume.

#### Importing Zvols

Click **Import Zvols** on the **Volumes** screen to open the **Import Zvol** dialog.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/InstanceImportZvol.png" alt="Import Zvol Dialog" id="Import Zvol Dialog" >}}

Enter the path or browse to select an existing Zvol in **Select Zvols**.

Select **Clone** to clone and promote a temporary snapshot of the zvol into a custom storage volume.
This option retains the original zvol while creating an identical copy as an instances volume.

Select **Move** to relocate the existing zvol to the ix-virt dataset as a volume.

#### Uploading ISO Images

Click **Upload ISO** to open a file browser.
Select an <file>.iso</file> file from your client computer to upload it to TrueNAS for use in instances.

{{< expand "Image Filename Requirements" "v" >}}
{{< include file="/static/includes/InstanceImageFilenames.md" >}}

This ensures the instance name works without conflicts in DNS records, the file system, security profiles, and as the instance hostname.
See [Instance name requirements](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/instance_properties/#instance-name-requirements) from Incus for more information.
{{< /expand >}}

#### Deleting Volumes

Click **Configuration > Manage Volumes** to access the **Volumes** screen.
Click <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Delete">delete</i> on any volume row to delete that volume.
The **Delete volume** dialog displays.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/InstancesDeleteVolume.png" alt="Delete Volume Dialog" id="Delete Volume Dialog" >}}

Select **Confirm** and then click **Continue** to delete the image.
TrueNAS disables the delete icon for active images to prevent accidental deletion.

### Mapping User and Group IDs

Click **Map User/Group IDs** on the **Configuration** dropdown list to open the **Map User and Group IDs** screen, which allows you to manually configure UID and GID mappings inside instances.
By default, user and group accounts within an instance are assigned UIDs and GIDs from a special private range starting at **2147000001**.
This mapping ensures security isolation for containers.
However, you can override these mappings to meet specific system requirements.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/MapUserGroupIDs.png" alt="Map User and Group IDs Screen" id="Map User and Group IDs Screen" >}}

Select **Users** or **Groups** to view mappings for individual user or group accounts, respectively.

Existing mappings are shown in a table containing the user or group name, host ID, and instance ID.
Click **<i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Delete">delete</i> Delete** on a row to delete that mapping.

To configure a new mapping, type an account name to search for it or select it from the dropdown list.
Select **Map to the same UID/GID in the instance** to directly map the host ID to the same ID in instances.
This means that the selected user or group ID on the host appears as the same ID in instances.

Disable **Map to the same UID/GID in the instance** to define a different instance ID for the user or group.
Enter an ID number to map in instances, for example *1000*.
This means that the selected user or group ID on the host appears as the configured ID in instances.

Click **Set** to create the mapping.
Changes take effect immediately, though instances can require a restart to reflect the changes.

Incorrect mappings can create permission issues within instances.

## Creating Instances

Click **Create New Instance** on the **Instances** screen to open the **Create Instance** configuration wizard with the settings to set up a new [container](#creating-a-container) or [virtual machine](#creating-a-virtual-machine).

## Accessing Instances

After selecting the instance row in the table to populate the **Details for *Instance*** widgets, locate the **Tools** widget.
You can open a shell, console, or VNC session directly from this widget.

Click **Shell** <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:console-line"></span> to open an **Instance Shell** session for command-line interaction with the instance.
  
For VMs, click **Serial Console** <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:console"></span> to open an **Instance Console** session to access the system console for the instance.

For VMs, click **VNC** to open a VNC connection using your preferred client.
It uses a VNC URL scheme (for example, `vnc://hostname.domain.com:5930`) to launch the session directly in the application.
If your environment does not support VNC URLs, you can manually connect using a VNC client by entering the host name or IP address followed by the port number without `vnc://` (for example, `hostname.domain.com:5930` or `IP:5930`).
