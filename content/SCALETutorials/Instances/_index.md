**Instances** allow users to set up containers or virtual machines (VMs) to run alongside TrueNAS.

A *Linux container* is a lightweight, isolated environment that shares the host system kernel while maintaining its own filesystem, processes, and network settings.
Containers start quickly, use fewer system resources than VMs, and scale efficiently, making them ideal for deploying and managing applications with minimal overhead.

A *virtual machine (VM)* is an environment on a host computer that operates like a separate physical computer.
VMs allow users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single machine.
VMs emulate hardware, providing greater isolation than containers but requiring more system resources.

## Creating a Virtual Machine
Before creating a VM, obtain an installer <file>.iso</file> or image file for the OS you intend to install, and create a [zvol]({{< relref "AddManageZvols.md" >}}) on a storage pool that is available for both the virtual disk and the OS install file.

If the VM needs to access local NAS storage, you need to create a network bridge to allow communication.
See [Accessing TrueNAS Storage from a VM](#accessing-truenas-storage-from-a-vm) below for more information.

To create a new VM, go to **Instances** and click **Add** to open the **Create Virtual Machine** configuration screen.
If you have not yet added a virtual machine to your system, click **Add Virtual Machines** to open the same screen.

1. Select the operating system you want to use from the **Guest Operating System** dropdown list.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/AddVMOperSys.png" alt="Operating System Settings" id="Operating System Settings" >}}

   Compare the recommended specifications for the guest operating system with your available host system resources when allocating virtual CPUs, cores, threads, and memory size.

2. Change other **Operating System** settings per your use case.

   Select **UTC** as the VM system time from the **System Clock** dropdown if you do not want to use the default **Local** setting.

   Select **Enable Display** to enable a SPICE Virtual Network Computing (VNC) remote connection for the VM.
      The **Bind** and **Password** fields display. If **Enable Display** is selected:

   Enter a display **Password**

   Use the dropdown menu to change the default IP address in **Bind** if you want to use a specific address as the display network interface, otherwise leave it set to **0.0.0.0**.
   The **Bind** menu populates any existing logical interfaces, such as static routes, configured on the system.
   **Bind** cannot be edited after VM creation.

   Click **Next**.

3. Enter the CPU and memory settings for your VM.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/AddVMMemory.png" alt="CPU and Memory" id="CPU and Memory" >}}

   If you selected Windows as the **Guest Operating System**, the **Virtual CPUs** field displays a default value of 2.
   The VM operating system might have operational or licensing restrictions on the number of CPUs.

   Do not allocate too much memory to a VM. Activating a VM with all available memory allocated to it can slow the host system or prevent other VMs from starting.

   Leave **CPU Mode** set to **Custom** if you want to select a CPU model.

   Use **Memory Size** and **Minimum Memory Size** to specify how much RAM to dedicate to this VM.
   To dedicate a fixed amount of RAM, enter a value (minimum 256 MiB) in the **Memory Size** field and leave **Minimum Memory Size** empty.

   To allow for memory usage flexibility (sometimes called ballooning), define a specific value in the **Minimum Memory Size** field and a larger value in **Memory Size**.
   The VM uses the **Minimum Memory Size** for normal operations but can dynamically allocate up to the defined **Memory Size** value in situations where the VM requires additional memory.
   Reviewing available memory from within the VM typically shows the **Minimum Memory Size**.

   Click **Next**.

4. Configure disk settings.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/CreateVirtualMachineDisks.png" alt="Disks" id="Disks" >}}

   Select **Create new disk image** to create a new zvol on an existing dataset.  
   Select **Use existing disk image** to use an existing zvol for the VM.

   Select either **AHCI** or **VirtIO** from the **Select Disk Type** dropdown list. We recommend using **AHCI** for Windows VMs.

   Select the location for the new zvol from the **Zvol Location** dropdown list.

   Enter a value in **Size (Examples: 500KiB, 500M, and 2TB)** to indicate the amount of space to allocate for the new zvol.

   Click **Next**.

5. Configure the network interface.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/AddVMNetwork.png" alt="Network Interface" id="Network Interface" >}}

   Select the network interface type from the **Adapter Type** dropdown list. Select **Intel e82585 (e1000)** as it offers a higher level of compatibility with most operating systems, or select **VirtIO** if the guest operating system supports para-virtualized network drivers.

   Select the network interface card to use from the **Attach NIC** dropdown list.
   If the VM needs to access local NAS storage, attach a [network bridge](#accessing-truenas-storage-from-a-vm) interface.

   Click **Next**.

6. Upload installation media for the operating system you selected.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/AddVMInstallMedia.png" alt="Installation Media" id="Installation Media" >}}

   You can create the VM without an OS installed. To add it either type the path or browse to the location and select it.

   To upload an <file>iso</file> select **Upload New Image File** and either enter the path or browse to the location of the file.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/CreateVMWInstallMediaUploadSCALE.png" alt="Upload Installation Media" id="Upload Installation Media" >}}

   Click **Upload** to begin the upload process. After the upload finishes, click **Next**.

7. Specify a GPU.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/AddVMGPU.png" alt="GPU Screen" id="GPU Screen" >}}

   {{< hint type="note" title="Supported GPUs" >}}
    TrueNAS does not have a list of approved GPUs at this time but TrueNAS does support various GPU from Nvidia, Intel, and AMD.
    As of 24.10, TrueNAS does not automatically install NVIDIA drivers. Instead, users must manually install drivers from the UI. For detailed instructions, see (https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasapps/#installing-nvidia-drivers).
   {{< /hint >}}

8. Confirm your VM settings, then click **Save**.

### Adding and Removing Devices
After creating the VM, you can add or remove virtual devices.

Click on the VM row on the **Virtual Machines** screen to expand it and show the options, then click <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Devices">device_hub</i> **Devices**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/VMDevicesListed.png" alt="Devices" id="Devices" >}}

{{<include file="/static/includes/addcolumnorganizer.md">}}

Device notes:

* A virtual machine attempts to boot from devices according to the **Device Order**, starting with **1000**, then ascending.
* A **CD-ROM** device allows booting a VM from a CD-ROM image like an installation CD.
  The CD image must be available in the system storage.

## Configuring Virtual Machine Network Access
Configure VM network settings during or after installation of the guest OS.
To communicate with a VM from other parts of your local network, use the IP address configured or assigned by DHCP within the VM.

To confirm network connectivity, send a ping to and from the VM and other nodes on your local network.

{{< expand "Debian OS Example" "v" >}}
Open a terminal in the Debian VM.

Enter `ip addr` and record the address.

Enter `ping` followed by the known IP or hostname of another client on the network, that is not your TrueNAS host.
Confirm the ping is successful.
To confirm internet access, you can also ping a known web server, such as `ping google.com`.

Log in to another client on the network and ping the IP address of your new VM.
Confirm the ping is successful.
{{< /expand >}}

### Accessing TrueNAS Storage From a VM
By default, VMs are unable to communicate directly with the host NAS.
If you want to access your TrueNAS directories from a VM, to connect to a TrueNAS data share, for example, you have multiple options.

If your system has more than one physical interface, you can assign your VMs to a NIC other than the primary one your TrueNAS server uses. This method makes communication more flexible but does not offer the potential speed of a bridge.

To create a bridge interface for the VM to use if you have only one physical interface, stop all existing apps, VMs, and services using the current interface, edit the interface and VMs, create the bridge, and add the bridge to the VM device.
See [Accessing NAS from VM]({{< relref "ContainerNASBridge.md" >}}) for more information.
