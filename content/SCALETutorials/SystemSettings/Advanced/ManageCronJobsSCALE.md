Cron jobs allow users to configure jobs that run specific commands or scripts on a regular schedule using [cron(8)](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/cron/cron.8.en.html "Cron Man Page"). Cron jobs help users run repetitive tasks.

{{< include file="/static/includes/AdvancedSettingsWarningSCALE.md" >}}

The **Cron Jobs** widget on the **System > Advanced Settings** screen displays **No Cron Jobs configured** until you add a cron job, and then it displays information on cron job(s) configured on the system.

Click **Add** to open the **Add Cron Job** configuration screen and create a new cron job. If you want to modify an existing cron job, click anywhere on the item to open the **Edit Cron Jobs** configuration screen populated with the settings for that cron job.
The **Add Cron Job** and **Edit Cron Job** configuration screens display the same settings.

Enter a description for the cron job.

Next, enter the full path to the command or script to run in **Command**. For example, for a command string to create a list of users on the system and write that list to a file, enter `cat /etc/passwd > users_$(date +%F).txt`.

Select a user account to run the command from the **Run As User** dropdown list. The user must have permissions allowing them to run the command or script.

Select a schedule preset or choose **Custom** to open the advanced scheduler.
An in-progress cron task postpones any later scheduled instances of the task until the one already running completes.

{{< expand "Cron Job Schedule Format" "v" >}}
Cron job schedules use six asterisks that represent minutes, hours, days of the month, days of the week, and months in that order.

For example, a schedule of *1 1 1 * sat,sun* would run at 01:01 AM, on day 1 of the month, and only on Saturday and Sunday.

Separate multiple values for a segment with commas, not spaces.

If you want to hide standard output (stdout) from the command, select **Hide Standard Output**. If left cleared, TrueNAS emails any standard output to the user account cron that ran the command.

To hide error output (stderr) from the command, select **Hide Standard Error**. If left cleared, TrueNAS emails any error output to the user account cron that ran the command.

Select **Enabled** to enable this cron job. Leave this checkbox cleared to disable the cron job without deleting it.

Click **Save**.
