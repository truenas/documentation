The **Services > NFS** configuration screen displays settings to customize the TrueNAS NFS service.

You can access it from **System > Services** screen, locate **NFS** and click <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure">edit</i> to open the screen, or use the **Config Service** option on the **Unix (NFS) Share** widget options menu found on the main **Sharing** screen.

Select **Start Automatically** to activate the NFS service when TrueNAS boots.

### Configuring NFS Service

We recommend using the default NFS settings unless you require specific settings.

Select the IP address from the **Bind IP Addresses** dropdown list if you want to use a specific static IP address, or leave this field blank for NFS to listen to all available addresses.

By default, TrueNAS dynamically calculates the number of threads the kernel NFS server uses.
To manually enter an optimal number of threads the kernel NFS server uses, clear **Calculate number of threads dynamically** and enter the number of threads you want in the **Specify number of threads manually** field.

If using NFSv4, select **NFSv4** from **Enabled Protocols**. **NFSv3 ownership model for NFSv4** clears, allowing you to enable or leave it clear.
Selecting **NFSv3 ownership model for NFSv4** deactivates the **Manage Group Server-side** option.

To force NFS shares to fail if the Kerberos ticket is unavailable, select **Require Kerberos for NFSv4**.

Next, enter a port to bind to in the field that applies:

* Enter a port to bind [mountd(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mountd.8.html) in **mountd(8) bind port**.
* Enter a port to bind [rpc.statd(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/statd.8.html)in **rpc.statd(8) bind port**.
* Enter a port to bind [rpc.lockd(8)](https://linux.die.net/man/8/rpc.lockd) in **rpc.lockd(8) bind port**.

Only select **Allow non-root mount** if the NFS client requires it to allow serving non-root mount requests.

Select **Manage Groups Server-side** to allow the server to determine group IDs based on server-side lookups rather than relying solely on the information provided by the NFS client.
This can support more than 16 groups and provide more accurate group memberships.
It is equivalent to setting the `--manage-gids` flag for [rpc.mountd](https://linux.die.net/man/8/rpc.mountd).
This setting assumes group membership is configured correctly on the NFS server.

Click **Save**.

Start the NFS service.
When TrueNAS is already connected to [Active Directory]({{< relref "/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}), setting **NFSv4** and **Require Kerberos for NFSv4** also requires a [Kerberos Keytab]({{< relref "/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}).
