An Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is a power backup system that ensures continuous electricity during outages, preventing downtime and damage.

## Setting Up UPS Service

Connect the TrueNAS system to the UPS device. To configure the UPS service, go to **System > Services**, finding **UPS**, and click <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure">edit</i>.

See [UPS Service Screen]({{< relref "UPSServicesScreenSCALE.md" >}}) for details on the UPS service settings.

Some UPS models are unresponsive with the default polling frequency (default is two seconds).
TrueNAS displays the issue in logs as a recurring error like **libusb_get_interrupt: Unknown error**.
If you get an error, decrease the polling frequency by adding an entry to **Auxiliary Parameters (ups.conf)**: `pollinterval = 10`.

For USB devices, the easiest way to determine the correct device name is to set **Show console messages** in **System > Advanced Settings**.
Plug in the USB device and look for a <file>/dev/ugen</file> or <file>/dev/uhid</file> device name in the console messages.

{{< expand "Can I attach Multiple Computers to One UPS?" "v" >}}
A UPS with adequate capacity can power multiple computers.
One computer connects to the UPS data port with a serial or USB cable.
This primary system makes UPS status available on the network for other computers.
The UPS powers the secondary computers, and they receive UPS status data from the primary system.
