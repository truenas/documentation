## Installed Applications Screen

The first time you go to **Apps**, the **Installed** applications screen displays an <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Apps Service Not Configured** status on the screen header.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsServiceNotConfigured.png" alt="Apps Service Not Configured" id="Apps Service Not Configured" >}}

After setting the pool apps uses, this changes to **Apps Service Running**.

The **Installed** applications screen displays **Check Available Apps** before you install the first application.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsInstalledAppsScreenNoApps.png" alt="Installed Applications Screen No Apps" id="Installed Applications Screen No Apps" >}}

Click **Check Available Apps** or **Discover Apps** to open the **[Discover](#using-the-discover-applications-screen)** screen to see application widgets available in the TRUENAS catalog.

After installing an application, the **Installed** screen populates the **Applications** area with a table listing installed applications.
Select an application to view the information widgets for applications, with options to edit the application settings, open container pod shell or logs, and access the **Web Portal** for the application, if applicable.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/InstalledAppsScreenWithApps.png" alt="Installed Applications Screen with Apps" id="Installed Applications Screen with Apps" >}}

Application widgets vary by app, but all include the **Application Info** and **Workloads** widgets. Some include the **History** and **Notes** widgets.

### Choosing the Apps Pool
You must choose the pool apps use before you can add applications.
The first time you go to the **Applications** screen, click **Settings > Choose Pool** to choose a storage pool for Apps.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsSettingsChoosePool.png" alt="Choosing a Pool for Apps" id="Choosing a Pool for Apps" >}}

We recommend keeping the application use case in mind when choosing a pool.
Select a pool with enough space for all the applications you intend to use.
For stability, we also recommend using SSD storage for the applications pool.

TrueNAS creates an *ix-applications* dataset on the chosen pool and uses it to store all container-related data.
The dataset is for internal use only.
Set up a new dataset before installing your applications if you want to store your application data in a location separate from other storage on your system.
For example, create the datasets for the Nextcloud application, and, if installing Plex, create the dataset(s) for Plex data storage needs.

{{< include file="/static/includes/AppsVMsNoHTTPS.md" >}}

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/SystemSettingsGUISettingsSCALE.png" alt="General System Settings" id="General System Settings" >}}

After an apps storage pool is configured, the status changes to <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:check-circle" color=#71BF44></span> **Apps Service Running**.

### Unsetting the Apps Pool
To select a different pool for apps to use, click **Settings > Unset Pool**. This turns off the Apps service until you choose another pool for apps to use.

### Changing Official Application Networking
Official applications use the default system-level Kubernetes node IP settings.

You can change the Kubernetes node IP to assign an external interface to your apps, separate from the web UI interface, in **Apps > Settings > Advanced Settings**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/KubernetesSettingsScreenTop.png" alt="Advanced/Kubernetes Settings" id="Advanced/Kubernetes Settings" >}}

We recommend using the default Kubernetes node IP (0.0.0.0) to ensure apps function correctly.

### Managing Container Images
The **Settings** dropdown includes an option 
Click **Settings** > **Manage Container Images** to open the **Manage Container Images** screen.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsManageContainerImages.png" alt="Apps Manage Container Images" id="Apps Manage Container Images" >}}

Update or delete images from this screen, or click **Pull Image** to download a specific custom image to TrueNAS.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsManageContainerImagesPullImage.png" alt="Pull a Container Image" id="Pull a Container Image" >}}

To download a specific image, click the button and enter a valid path and tag to the image.
Enter the path using the format *registry*/*repository*/*image* to identify the specific image.
The default **latest** tag downloads the most recent image version.

When downloading a private image, enter user account credentials that allow access to the private registry.

### Upgrading Apps
Apps display a yellow circle with an exclamation point that indicates an upgrade is available, and the **Installed** application screen banner displays an **Update** or **Update All** button when upgrades are available.
To upgrade an app to the latest version, click **Update** on the **Application Info** widget or to upgrade multiple apps, click the **Update All** button on the **Installed** applications banner.
Both buttons only display if TrueNAS SCALE detects an available update for installed applications.

**Update** opens an upgrade window that includes two selectable options, **Images (to be updated)** and **Changelog**.
Click on the down arrow to see the options available for each.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppUpdateWindow.png" alt="Update Application Window" id="Update Application Window" >}}

Click **Upgrade** to begin the process. A counter dialog opens showing the upgrade progress.
When complete, the update badge and buttons disappear and the application **Update** state on the **Installed** screen changes from **Update Available** to **Up to date**.

### Deleting Apps
To delete an application, click <i class="fa fa-stop" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Stop** on application row.
After the app status changes to stopped, click **Delete** on the **Application Info** widget for the selected application to open the **Delete** dialog.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsDeleteAppDialog.png" alt="Delete Application Dialog" id="Delete Application Dialog" >}}

Click **Confirm** then **Continue** to delete the application.

### Using App Settings

The **Settings** dropdown list at the top of the **Installed** applications screen provides these options:
* [**Choose Pool**](#choosing-the-apps-pool) where you set the pool apps uses and create the **ix-applications** dataset.
* [**Advanced Setting**](#changing-offiical-application-networking) where you can make changes to the Kubernetes node IP setting.
* [**Unset Pool**](#unsetting-the-apps-pool) where you can unset the apps pool, and if desired, then choose a different pool for apps to use.
* [**Manage Container Images**](#managing-container-images) where you can manage every container image downloaded to TrueNAS.

## Discover Applications Screen
The **Discover** screen displays **New & Updated Apps** application widgets for the official TRUENAS catalog **Chart**, **Community**, and **Enterprise** trains.
Non-Enterprise systems show the **Chart** catalog of app by default.
The **Chart** catalog train has official applications that are pre-configured and only require a name during deployment.

Enterprise applications display automatically for Enterprise=licensed systems, but community users can add these apps using the **Manage Catalogs** screen.
App trains display based on the **Trains** settings on the **Edit Catalog** screen.

See [Using SCALE Catalogs]({{< relref "usingcatalogs.md" >}}) for more information on managing catalogs.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsDiscoverScreen.png" alt="Applications Discover Screen" id="Applications Discover Screen" >}}

The **Discover** screen includes three links: 

* [**Refresh Charts**](#refreshing-charts) 
* **Manage Installed Apps** opens the **Installed** application screen.
* [**Manage Catalogs**]({{< relref "UsingCatalogs.md" >}})

The **Custom App** button opens a wizard where you can install unofficial apps or an app not included in a catalog.

Browse the widgets or use the search field to find an available applications.
Click on an application widget to go to the application information screen.

### Refreshing Charts
You can refresh the charts catalog by clicking **Refresh Charts** on the **Discover** screen.
You can also refresh all catalogs from the **Catalogs** screen. Click **Manage Catalogs**, then click **Refresh All**.
Refresh the catalog after adding or editing the catalogs on your system.

### Using the Discover Screen Filters
To filter the app widgets shown, click the down arrow to the right of **Filters**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/DiscoverAppsScreenFilterOptions.png" alt="Discover Apps Filter Options" id="Discover Apps Filter Options" >}}

You can filter by catalog, app category, name, catalog name, and date last updated.
Click on the option then begin typing the name of the app into the search field to narrow the widgets to fit the filter criteria.
Click in **Categories** to select apps based on the selection you make.
Click in the field again to add another category from the dropdown list to select multiple categories.

## Installing Official Applications
From the application information screen, click **Install** to open the installation wizard for the application.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/MinIOS3AppInfoScreen.png" alt="Application Information Screen Example" id="Application Information Screen Example" >}}

After installing an application, the **Installed** applications screen shows the application in the **Deploying** state.
It changes to **Running** when the application is ready to use.

The installation wizard configuration sections vary by application, with some including more configuration areas than others.
Click **Install** to review settings ahead of time to check for required settings.
Click **Discover** on the breadcrumb at the top of the installation wizard to exiting the screen without saving and until you are ready return and configure the app settings.

All applications include these basic setting sections:

### Application Name Settings

**Application Name** shows the default name for the application.

  If deploying more than one instance of the application, you must change the default name. Also includes the **version** number for the application.
  Do not change the version number for official apps or those included in a SCALE catalog.
  When a new version becomes available, the **Installed** application screen banner and application row displays an update alert, and the **Application Info** widget displays an update button> Updating the app changes the version shown on the edit wizard for the application.

### Application Configuration Settings

***Application* Configuration** shows settings that app requires to deploy.
  This section can be named anything. For example, the MinIO app uses  **MinIO Configuration**.

  Typical settings include user credentials, environment variables, additional argument settings, name of the node, or even sizing parameters.

  If not using the default user and group provided, add the new user (and group) to manage the application before using the installation wizard.

### Network Configuration Settings

**Network Configuration** shows network settings the app needs to communicate with SCALE and the Internet.
  Settings include the default port assignment, host name, IP addresses, and other network settings.

  If changing the port number to something other than the default setting, refer to [Default Ports](https://www.truenas.com/docs/references/defaultports/) for a list of used and available port numbers.

  Some network configuration settings include the option to add a certificate. Create the certificate authority and certificate before using the installation wizard if using a certificate is required for the application.

### Storage Configuration Settings

**Storage Configuration** shows options to configure storage for the application.
  Storage options include using the default ixVolume setting that adds a storage volume under the **ix-applications** dataset, host path where you select existing dataset(s) to use, or in some cases the SMB share option where you configure a share for the application to use.
  The **Add** button allows you to configure additional storage volumes for the application to use in addition to the main storage volume (dataset).

  If the application requires specific datasets, configure these before using the installation wizard.

  If setting host path storage, select **Enable ACL** to configure ACL entries for the selected dataset.

  {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/HostPathACL.png" alt="Host Path ACL Configuration Settings" id="Host Path ACL Configuration Settings" >}}

  Browse to or select the dataset in **Host Path**.

  {{< include file="/static/includes/FileExplorerFolderIcons.md" >}}

  Select **Add** next to **ACL Entries** to add a set of **ID Type**, **ID**, and **Access** fields to configure an entry.
  Click **Add** again for each additional ACL entry.

  Select **Force Flag** under **ACL Options** to apply the ACL even if the path has existing data.

### Resources Configuration Settings

**Resources Configuration** shows CPU and memory settings for the container pod.
   This section can also be named **Resource Limits**. In most cases you can accept the default settings, or you can change these settings to limit the system resources available to the application.

After installing an app, you can modify most settings by selecting the app on the **Installed** applications screen and then clicking the **Edit** button on the **Application Info** widget for that app.

Refer to individual tutorials in the Community or Enterprise sections of the Documentation Hub for more details on application settings.
Installation and editing wizards include tooltips to help users configure application settings.

### Allocating GPU
Users with compatible hardware can allocate one or more GPU devices to an application for use in hardware acceleration.
This is an advanced process that could require significant troubleshooting depending on installed GPU device(s) and application-specific criteria.

GPU devices can be available for the host operating system (OS) and applications or can be [isolated for use in a Virtual Machine (VM)]({{< relref "managegpuscale.md" >}}).
A single GPU cannot be shared between the OS/applications and a VM.

Allocate GPU from the **Resources Configuration** section of the application installation wizard screen or the **Edit** screen for a deployed application.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/ResourcesConfiguration.png" alt="Resources Configuration" id="Resources Configuration" >}}

Click the **GPU Resource** allocation row for the type of GPU (AMD, Intel, or Nvidia) and select the number of GPU devices the application is allowed access to.
It is not possible at this time to specify which available GPU device is allocated to the application and assigned devices can change on reboot.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/ResourcesConfigurationAllocateGPU.png" alt="Select GPU Allocation" id="Select GPU Allocation" >}}

{{< expand "Troubleshooting GPU Allocation" "v" >}}
If installed GPU devices do not populate as available for allocation in **GPU Configuration**:

1. Ensure the GPU devices you want to allocate are not configured as isolated.
   Go to **System Settings > Advanced** and locate the **Isolated GPU Device(s)** widget.
   If necessary, click **Configure**, deselect the device(s) you want to allocate, and click **Save**.

2. Ensure the GPU devices you want to allocate are not assigned to any existing VMs.
   Go to **Virtualization**.
   Select an existing VM and click on that row to expand it, then click **Edit**.
   Scroll down to **GPU** and review configured devices.
   If necessary, deselect the device you want to allocate to applications.
   Repeat for any additional VMs on the system.

If the GPU was previously isolated and/or assigned to a VM, a reboot could be required to free it up for app allocation.
Restart the system then return to the **Resources Configuration** section of the application to see if expected devices are available.

## Installing Custom Applications
To deploy a custom application, go to **Discover** and click **Custom App** to open the **Install Custom App** screen.
See [Using Install Custom App]({{< relref "UsingCustomApp.md" >}}) for more information.

### Changing Custom Application Networking
Custom applications use the system-level Kubernetes Node IP settings by default.

You can assign an external interface to custom apps using  one of the **Networking** section  settings found on the **Install Custom App** screen.

Unless you need to run an application separately from the Web UI, we recommend using the default Kubernetes **Node IP** (0.0.0.0) to ensure apps function correctly.
