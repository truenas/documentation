6. Turn failover back on.
   Go to **System > Failover** and select **Disable Failover** to clear the checkmark and turn failover back on, then click **Save**.

   The system might reboot.
   Monitor the status of controller 2 and wait until the controller is back up and running, then click **Sync To Peer**.
   Select **Reboot standby TrueNAS controller** and **Confirm**, then click **Proceed** to start the sync operation.
   The controller reboots, and SCALE syncs controller 2 with controller 1, which adds the network settings and pool to controller 2.
