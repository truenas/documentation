## Configuring Enterprise (HA) Network Settings
{{< hint type=important >}}
You must disable the failover before you can configure network settings!
{{< /hint >}}

To configure network settings:

1. Disable the failover service.
   Go to **System Settings > Failover**.
   Select **Disable Failover** and click **Save**.

2. [Edit the Global Network settings]({{< relref "AddingGlobalConf.md" >}}) to add or change the host and domain names, DNS name server and default gateway address. 
   If enabled on your network, TrueNAS uses DHCP to assign global network addresses as well as the SCALE UI access IP address. If not enabled in your network, you must enter these values yourself. 
   Review the **Global Configuration** settings to verify they match the information your network administrator provided.

3. Edit the primary network interface.
   Go to **Network** and click on the primary interface **eno1** to open the **Edit Interface** screen for this interface.

   a. Turn DHCP off. Select **DHCP** to clear the checkbox.

   b. Add the failover settings. Select **Critical**, and then select **1** on the **Failover Group** dropdown list.

   c. Add the virtual IP (VIP) and controller 2 IP. Click **Add** for **Aliases** to display the additional IP address fields. 
      
      ![EditInterfaceAddAliasesHA](/images/SCALE/22.12/EditInterfaceAddAliasesHA.png "Edit Network Interface Add Alias IP Addresses")

      1. Type the IP address for controller 1 into **IP Address (This Controller)** and select the CIDR number from the dropdown list.

      2. Type the controller 2 IP address into **IP Address (TrueNAS Controller 2)** field.

      3. Type the VIP address into **Virtual IP Address (Failover Address)** field.

      4. Click **Save**

   After editing the interface settings, the **Test Changes** button displays. You have 60 seconds to test and then save changes before they revert. If this occurs, edit the interface again.

4. Turn failover back on. 
   Go to **System Settings > Failover**
   Select **Disable Failover** to clear the checkmark and turn failover back on, then click **Save**. 

   The system might reboot. Monitor the status of controller 2 and wait until the controller is back up and running, then click **Sync To Peer**. 
   Select **Reboot standby TrueNAS controller** and **Confirm**, then click **Proceed** to start the sync operation. The controller reboots, and SCALE syncs controller 2 with controller 1, which adds the network settings and pool to controller 2.
