In general, a [bridge](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6325) refers to various methods of combining (aggregating) multiple network connections into a single aggregate network.

TrueNAS uses [bridge(4)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?bridge(4)) as the kernel bridge driver.
[Bridge(8)](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/bridge) is a command for configuring the bridge in Linux.
While the examples focus on the deprecated brctl(8) from the bridge-utilities package, we use ip(8) and bridge(8) from iproute2 instead.
Refer to the FAQ section that covers bridging topics more generally.

Network bridging does not inherently aggregate bandwidth like [link aggregation (LAGG)]({{< relref "settinguplagg.md" >}}).
Bridging is often used for scenarios that require extending a network segment or combining different types of network traffic.

You can use bridging to integrate different types of networks (e.g., wireless and wired networks) or to segment traffic within the same network.
You can also use a bridge to allow a VM configured on TrueNAS to communicate with the host system.
See [Accessing NAS from a VM or Apps]({{< relref "ContainerNASBridge.md" >}}) for more information.
