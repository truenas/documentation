Use the **Global Configuration Settings** screen to add general network settings like the default gateway and DNS name servers to allow external communication.

To add new or change existing network interfaces see [Managing Interfaces]({{< relref "/SCALETutorials/Network/Interfaces/_index.md" >}}).

## Adding Network Settings

Go to **Network** and click **Settings** on the **Global Configuration** widget to open the **Edit Global Configuration** screen, then:

1. Enter the host name for your TrueNAS in **Hostname**. For example, *host*.

2. Enter the system domain name in **Domain**. For example, *example.com*.

3. Enter the IP addresses for your DNS name servers in the **Nameserver 1**, **Nameserver 2**, and/or **Nameserver 3** fields.
   For home users, enter **8.8.8.8** in the **Nameserver 1** field so your TrueNAS SCALE can communicate externally with the Internet.

4. Enter the IP address for your default gateway into the **IPv4 Default Gateway** if you are using IPv4 IP addresses.
   Enter the IP address in the **IPv6 Default Gateway** if you are using IPv6 addresses.

5. Select the **Outbound Network** radio button for outbound service capability.

   Select **Allow All** to permit all TrueNAS SCALE services that need external communication to do that or select **Deny All** to prevent that external communication. Select **Allow Specific** and then use the dropdown list to pick the services you want to allow to communicate externally.

   Click on as many services for which you want to permit external communications. Unchecked services cannot communicate externally.

6. Click **Save**. The **Global Configuration** widget on the **Network** screen updates to show the new settings.
