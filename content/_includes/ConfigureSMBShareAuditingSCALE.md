Configure and enable SMB auditing for an SMB share at creation or when modifying an existing share.

SMB auditing is only supported for SMB2 (or newer) protocol-negotiated SMB sessions.
SMB1 connections to shares with auditing enabled are rejected.

From the **Add SMB Share** or **Edit SMB Share** screen, click **Advanced Options** and scroll down to **Audit Logging**.

Selecting **Enable** turns auditing on for the share you are creating or editing.

Use the **Watch List** and **Ignore List** functions to add audit logging groups to include or exclude.
Click in **Watch List** to see a list of user groups on the system.
Click on a group to add it to the list and record events generated by user accounts that are members of the group.
Leave **Watch List** blank to include all groups, otherwise auditing is restricted to only the groups added.

Click in **Ignore List** to see a list of user groups on the system..
Click on a group to add it to the list and explicitly avoid recording any events generated by user accounts that are members of this group.

The **Watch List** takes precedence over the **Ignore List** when using both lists.

Click **Save**.
