If the system has active sharing configurations (SMB, NFS, iSCSI), disable these sharing services in **System Settings > Services** before adding and configuring the MinIO application.
Start any sharing services after MinIO completes the install and starts.

Multi mode configurations require a self-signed certificate. If creating a cluster each system requires a self-signed certificate.

1. Go to **Credentials > Certificates** to add a self-signed certificate authority (CA) and certificate for the MinIO application to use.

2. Click **Add** on the **Certificate Authorities (CA)** widget to open the **Add Certificate Authority** screen.

   a. Enter a name for the CA. For example, *minio*. 
      Accept the defaults for **Type** and **Profile**, then click **Next**.

   b. Accept the defaults on **Certificate Options** unless you want to set an expiration on the certificate. 
      Enter a new value in **Lifetime** to impose an expiration time period, then click **Next**. 

   c. Enter location and organization values for your installation in the **Certificate Subject** fields. 
      Enter the email address you want to receive system notifications.

   d. Enter your system IP address in **Subject Alternate Names**, then click **Next**. 
      If configuring MinIO in a MNMD cluster, enter the system IP addresses for each system in the cluster.

   e. Accept the default values on **Extra Constraints**, then click **Next**.

   f. Review the CA configuration then click **Save**.

3. Click **Add** on the **Certificates** widget to open the **Add Certificate** screen.

   a. Enter a name for the certificate. For example, *minio*. 
      Select **Internal Certificate** as **Type** and **HTTPS RSA Certificate** in **Profiles**, then click **Next**.

   b. Select the newly-created CA in **Signing Certificate Authority**. 
      Accept the rest of the defaults unless you want to set an expiration on the certificate. 
      Enter a new value in **Lifetime** to impose an expiration time period, then click **Next**. 

   c. Enter location and organization values for your installation in the **Certificate Subject** fields. 
      Enter the email address you want to receive system notifications.

   d. Enter your system IP address in **Subject Alternate Names**, then click **Next**.
      If configuring MinIO in a MNMD cluster, enter the system IP addresses for each system in the cluster.

   e. Accept the default values on **Extra Constraints**, then click **Next**.

   f. Review the CA configuration then click **Save**.

4. Download the certificate and install it.
   
   a. Click the download icon on the **Certificates** widget to start the download. When complete, click the browser download icon to open in a File Explorer window.

   b. Right click on the certificate.crt file, then click **Install Certificate**. Click **Open** on the **Open File** window.

Add a self-signed certificate for the MinIO application to use.

Create four datasets named, data1, data2, data3, and data4. 
Do not nest these datasets under each other. Select the parent dataset, for example *apps*, before you click **Create Dataset**.
Set the **Share Type** to **apps** for each dataset. 
MinIO assigns the correct properties during the installation process so you do not need to configure the ACL or permissions.
