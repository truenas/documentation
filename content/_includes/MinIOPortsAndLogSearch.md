MinIO containers use server port 9000. The MinIO Console communicates using port 9001.

You can configure the API and UI access node ports and the MinIO domain name if you have TLS configured for MinIO. 

To store your MinIO container audit logs, select **Enable Log Search API** and enter the amount of storage you want to allocate to logging. 
The default is 5 disks.
