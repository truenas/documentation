Kerberos is extremely complex. Only system administrators experienced with configuring Kerberos should attempt it. 
Misconfiguring Kerberos settings, realms, and keytabs can have a system-wide impact beyond Active Directory or LDAP,  and can result in system outages.
Do not attempt configure or make changes if you do not know what you are doing!
