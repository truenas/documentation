| `group` | Integer or String | Yes* | Assigns the account to an existing group. <br> Ex. <code>group=<i>value</i></code> <br> &emsp; Where *value* is either the group name or Group Identification number (GID). <br> *Required when `group_create` is set to false. |
| `group_create` | Boolean | Yes*| Set to `true` to create a new group based on the `username` value and assign the account to it. Default state is `false`. <br> Ex. <code>group_create=<i>true</i></code> <br> &emsp; Where *true* is a boolean variable. <br> *Required when an existing group is not assigned. |
| `home` | String | No | Sets a home directory for the account. Defaults to `/nonexistent` if not defined. <br> Requires `home_create=true` if the desired directory does not exist. <br> Ex. <code>home="<i>/mnt/tank/staff/</i>"</code> <br> &emsp; Where */mnt/tank/staff/* is an existing directory. |
| `home_mode` | String | No | Sets home directory permissions using octal permission values. Defaults to `700`. <br> Ex. <code>home_mode=<i>700</i></code> <br> &emsp; Where *700* is an octal value representing the desired permission mode. |
| `home_create` | Boolean | No | If set to `true`, creates a new home directory for the user within a selected path defined by `home`. Default state is `false`. Reverts to default after the directory is created. <br> Ex. <code>home="<i>/mnt/tank/</i>" home_create=<i>true</i></code> <br> &emsp; Where */mnt/tank/* is the desired parent path and *true* is the boolean variable. <br> &emsp; This command creates a new home directory at **/mnt/tank/**. The directory name is the account username. |

Defaults to `/usr/bin/zsh` if not defined. <br> Retrieve available choices using `user.shell_choices`. <br> Ex. <code>shell="/usr/bin/<i>bash</i>"</code> <br> &emsp; Where *bash* is the desired shell choice in the **/usr/bin** directory. |

| `sudo_commands_nopasswd` | Array | No | Sets any sudo commands the user is allowed to use without entering a password. Exercise caution when allowing sudo commands without password prompts.
