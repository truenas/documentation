| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **devfs_ruleset** | The [devfs(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=devfs) ruleset number to enforce when mounting devfs in the jail. The default **0** means no ruleset is enforced. Mounting devfs inside a jail is only possible when the **allow_mount** and **allow_mount_devfs** permissions are enabled and enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2. |
| **exec_start** | Commands to run in the jail environment after the jail is created. Example: `sh /etc/rc`. The pseudo-parameters section of [JAIL(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jail) describes exec.start usage. |
| **exec_stop** | Commands to run in the jail environment before the jail is removed and after exec.prestop commands complete. Example: sh /etc/rc.shutdown. |
| **exec_prestart** | Commands to run in the system environment before a jail is started. |
| **exec_poststart** | Commands to run in the system environment after a jail is started and after any exec_start commands are finished. |
| **exec_prestop** | Commands to run in the system environment before a jail is stopped. |
| **exec_poststop** | Commands to run in the system environment after a jail is stopped. |
| **exec_jail_user** | Enter either root or another valid username. Inside the jail, this user runs the commands. |
| **exec_system_user** | Run commands in the jail as this user. By default, the current user runs these commands. |
| **securelevel** | The value of the jail [securelevel](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/faq/security.html#idp60202568) sysctl. A jail never has a lower securelevel setting than the host system. Setting this parameter allows a higher securelevel setting. If the host system securelevel* setting is changed, the jail secure level is at least as secure. |
| **sysvmsg** | Allows or denies access to SYSV IPC message primitives. Use the dropdown list to select from **Inherit**, **New** or **Disable**.<br> Select **Inherit** to make all IPC objects on the system visible to the jail.<br> Select **New* to make only objects the jail creates using the private key namespace visible. The system and parent jails have access to the jail objects but not private keys.<br> Select **Disable** when the jail cannot perform any sysvmsg related system calls. |
| **sysvsem** | Allows or denies access to SYSV IPC semaphore primitives. Use dropdown list to select from **Inherit**, **New** or **Disable**.<br> Use **Inherit** to make all IPC objects on the system visible to the jail.<br> Select **New** to make only objects the jail creates using the private key namespace visible. The system and parent jails have access to the jail objects but not private keys.<br> Select **Disable** when the jail cannot perform any sysvmem related system calls. |
| **sysvshm** | Allows or denies access to SYSV IPC shared memory primitives. Use dropdown list to select from **Inherit**, **New** or **Disable**.<br> Select **Inherit** to make all IPC objects on the system visible to the jail.<br> Select **New** to make only objects the jail creates using the private key namespace visible. The system and parent jails have access to the jail objects but not private keys.<br> Select **Disable** when the jail cannot perform any sysvshm related system calls. |
| **vnet_interfaces** | A space-delimited list of network interfaces attached to a VNET enabled jail after it is created. Interfaces are released when the jail is removed. |
| **allow_set_hostname** | Select to allow changing the jail host name with [hostname(1)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=hostname) or [sethostname(3)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sethostname). |
| **allow_sysvipc** | Select to choose whether a process in the jail has access to System V IPC primitives. Equivalent to setting **sysvmsg**, **sysvsem**, and **sysvshm** to **Inherit**. Deprecated in FreeBSD 11.0 and newer! Use **sysvmsg**, **sysvsem**, and **sysvshm** instead. |
| **allow_raw_sockets** | Select to allow raw sockets. Utilities like [ping(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ping) and [traceroute(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=traceroute) require raw sockets. When selected, source IP addresses are enforced to comply with the IP addresses bound to the jail, ignoring the IP_HDRINCL flag on the socket. |
| **allow_chflags**| Select to treat jail users as privileged and allow the manipulation of system file flags. Secure level constraints are still enforced. |
| **allow_mlock** | Enables running services that require [mlock(2)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mlock) in a jail. |
| **allow_vmm** | Allows the jail to access the bhyve virtual machine monitor (VMM). The jail must have FreeBSD 12.0 or newer installed with the [vmm(4)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=vmm) kernel module loaded. |
| **allow_quotas** | Select to allow the jail root to administer quotas on jail file systems. This includes file systems the jail shares with other jails or with non-jailed parts of the system. |
| **allow_socket_af** | Select to allow access to other protocol stacks beyond IPv4, IPv6, local (UNIX), and route. Warning, jail functionality does not exist for all protocol stacks. |
| **allow_mount** | Select to allow privileged users inside the jail to mount and unmount file system types marked as jail-friendly. Also use dropdown list to select from list of options **allow_mount_devfs**, **allow_mount_fusefs**, **allow_mount_nullfs**, **allow_mount_procfs**, **allow_mount_tmpfs** or **allow_mount_zfs**.  |
