The TrueNAS project welcomes all documentation contributions!
We're using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create this documentation website and the [Docsy theme](https://www.docsy.dev/) for general website styling.
Articles are written in a combination of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) syntax

The tutorials in this section are designed to guide you with different kinds of documentation contributions.
There is also an article template that you can copy and use to submit new articles.
Please feel free to propose changes and add new content in these articles to help others learn how to contribute to project documentation!
