TrueCommand records all user account activity in a system log.
For example, if a user deletes a system from TrueCommand, the log records which user deleted it along with other information associated with the deleted system.

To view the system log, open the **Configure** <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings"></i>&nbsp; menu and click **Logs**.

All system log entries are shown by default.
To hide specific categories of log entry, make selections in the **Hide** drop down.
All system logs can be displayed again by clicking **SHOW ALL**.
Logs can also be filtered by searching in the **Filter** text field.

Click an entry in the log to show detailed information about the event.
You can also click **DOWNLOAD ALL LOGS** to download a `.json` file that contains all system log entries.
