The task manager shows a list of tasks performed by the TrueNAS system
starting with the most recent. Click a task name to display its start time,
progress, finish time, and whether the task succeeded. If a task failed,
the error status is shown.

Tasks with log file output have a *View Logs* button to show the
log files.

The task manager can be opened by clicking
<i class="material-icons">assignment</i>. Close the task manager by clicking
*CLOSE*, clicking anywhere outside the task manager dialog, or by pressing
<kbd>Esc</kbd>.
