The **Replication Task** widget on the **Data Protection** screen lists replication tasks configured on the TrueNAS system.
Replication tasks work with periodic snapshot tasks to complete the replication.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/DataProtection/ReplicationTasksWidget.png" alt="Replication Task Widget" id="Replication Task Widget" >}}

The **Replication Tasks** widget displays **No Replication Tasks configured** before you add a task.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/DataProtection/ReplicationTasksWidgetNoTasks.png" alt="Replication Task Widget No Tasks" id="Replication Task Widget No Tasks" >}}

Click **Replication Task** on the widget heading to open the **[Replications Tasks](#replication-tasks-screen)** screen that lists all tasks configured on the system.

**Add** on the **Replication Task** widget opens the **[Replication Task Wizard](#replication-task-wizard)**.

The <span class="material-icons">edit</span> **Edit** icon opens the **[Edit Replication Task](#edit-replication-task-screen)** screen.

The **[<span class="material-icons">play_arrow</span> Run Now](#run-now-option)** icon opens a dialog.

The **[<span class="material-icons">restore</span> Restore](#restore-option)** icon to opens the **Restore Replication Task** window.

The **[<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:download"></span> Download encryption keys](#download-encryption-keys-option)** icon downloads any encryption keys associated with the task.

The **[<span class="material-icons">delete</span> Delete](#delete-option)** icon  opens a delete confirmation dialog.

**State** displays the status of the replication task as **SUCCESS** for completed tasks, **FAILED** if the task fails to complete the sync, and **PENDING** for tasks that have not run yet.
Click on the state oval to open the **Logs** dialog for that task. **Download Logs** saves a copy of the current task logs.

[Configure SSH]({{< relref "AddSSHConnectionKeyPair.md" >}}) in TrueNAS before creating a remote replication task. This ensures that new snapshots are regularly available for replication.

## Replication Tasks Screen
The **Replications Tasks** screen lists the replication tasks configured on the system.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/DataProtection/ReplicationTasksListScreen.png" alt="Replication Task List" id="Replication Task List" >}}

**Columns** displays a list of option to customize the list view to add or remove information to the table. Options are **Select All**, **Direction**, **Transport**, **SSH Connection**, **Source Dataset**, **Target Dataset**, **Recursive**, **Auto**, **Enabled**, **State**, **Last Snapshot**, and **Reset to Defaults**.

Before adding replication tasks this screen displays **No Replication Tasks** and the **Add Replication Tasks** option that opens the **Replication Task Wizard**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/DataProtection/ReplicationTasksListNoTasks.png" alt="Replication Task No Tasks" id="Replication Task No Tasks" >}}

Click anywhere on a task row to expand it and show details about that task and the options to run, restore, edit or delete that task.

Click **Confirm** to activate **Delete**.

## Add Replication Task Options
There are two ways to add a replication task, the wizard and the advanced creation screen.
These two methods share many settings that are described below.
Shared settings are documented these sections:
* **[Encryption](#encryption-options)**
* **[Also include snapshots with the name](#what-and-where-wizard-screen)**
* **[Schedule](#when-wizard-screen)**

**Add**, or if no replication task exist, **Add Replication Tasks** opens the wizard.

## Replication Task Wizard
The wizard has two screens:

* **What and Where** settings specify the task name, data source and destinations, the type of replication (local or remote), transport options (SSH connection).
* **When** settings specify when to run the task and how long to retain the replicated snapshots.

**Advanced Replication Creation** opens the **Add Replication Task** screen with the same settings found in the wizard and more advanced settings.

### What and Where Wizard Screen
The **What and Where** screen allows loading source and destination information from a previous task, setting the source and destination direction for the transfer and the datasets and directories to use, allows adding encryption and an SSH connection for remote replications, specifying the naming schema to use, and giving a name to the task.

The **[Encryption](#encryption-setting-options)** and **[SSH Connection](#ssh-settings)** options show when the source or destination is set to **On a Different System**.

Settings change based on the **[Source Location](#source-and-destination-options)** and **[Destination Location](#destination-location-setting-options)** option selected. Options are, **On this System** (local replication) and **On a Different System** (remote replication).

{{< include file="/static/includes/FileExplorerFolderIcons.md" >}}

**[Also include snapshots with the name](#snapshot-naming-options)** options show different snapshots settings based on the naming option selected.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/DataProtection/ReplicationWizardWhatAndWhere.png" alt="Replication Task Wizard What and When" id="Replication Task Wizard What and When" >}}

Setting **Source Location** to **On This System** and **Destination Location** to **On a Different System** and making naming schema choices changes the the wizard screen to show all available settings.

| **Begin** | Displays after selecting *Hourly* in **By snapshot creation time**. Select a time range for the specific periodic snapshots to replicate, in 15 minute increments. Periodic Snapshots created before this selected time are not included in the replication. |
| **End** | Displays after selecting *Hourly* in **By snapshot creation time**. Select a time range for the specific periodic snapshots to replicate, in 15 minute increments. Periodic Snapshots created after this selected time are not included in the replication. |
| **Also include snapshots with the name** | These radio buttons change the naming schema setting option below it. See [Snapshot Naming](#snapshot-naming-options) in the wizard section for details on this option and the radio buttons. |
| **Matching naming schema** | Displays the **Also Include Naming Schema** setting. |
| **Matching regular expression** | Displays the **Matching regular expression** setting. |
| **Also Include Naming Schema** | Displays after selecting the **Matching naming schema** radio button. Enter the pattern of naming custom snapshots to include in the replication with the periodic snapshot schedule. Enter the [strftime(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html) strings that match the snapshots to include in the replication. When a periodic snapshot is not linked to the replication, enter the naming schema for manually created snapshots. Has the same %Y, %m, %d, %H, and %M string requirements as the **Naming Schema** in a **Add Periodic Snapshot Task**. Separate entries by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. |
| **Matching regular expression** | Displays after selecting the **Matching regular expression** radio button. Enter the regular expressions snapshot should match. Using this option replicates all snapshots with names matching the specified regular expression. This process reads snapshot metadata to determine snapshot creation order. This slows regular performance on the systems with large number of snapshots. |
| **Save Pending Snapshots** | Select to prevent source system snapshots that have failed replication from being automatically removed by the **Snapshot Retention Policy**. |

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Run Automatically** | Select to either start this replication task immediately after the linked periodic snapshot task completes.  |
| **Schedule** | Select to create a replication schedule if not selecting **Run Automatically**. Displays the **Frequency** and **Only Replicate Snapshots Matching Schedule** options. |
| **Frequency** | Displays after selecting **Schedule**. Select a preset schedule or choose **Custom** to use the advanced scheduler. |
| **Begin** | Displays after selecting *Hourly* in **Frequency**. Select the start time for the replication task. |
| **End** | Displays after selecting *Hourly* in **Frequency**. Select the end time for the replication task. A replication that is already in progress can continue to run past this time. |
| **Only Replicate Snapshots Matching Schedule** | Displays after selecting **Schedule**. Select to use the **Schedule** in place of the **Replicate Specific Snapshots** time frame. The **Schedule** values are read over the **Replicate Specific Snapshots** time frame. |

## Edit Replication Task Screen
The **Edit Replication Task** screen displays most of the settings found on the advanced **[Add Replication Task](#advanced-replication-creation-screen)** screen with a few exceptions.

* **[General](#general-and-transport-options-settings)** settings do not include the **Direction** option.
  The **Transport** settings on the edit screen are the same settings as the [advanced creation](#general-and-transport-options-settings) settings.
* **[Source](#advanced-source-options)** and **[Destination](#advanced-destination-options)** setting options are the same as the advanced creation settings.
* **[Replication Schedule](#replication-schedule-advanced-options)** setting options are the same as the advanced creation settings.

See the section linked above for information on the **Edit Replication Task** screen settings.
