Idmap in Linux is essentially a translation of a range of IDs into another or the same range of IDs.

{{< hint type=warning >}}
Only administrators experienced with configuring Id mapping should attempt to add new or edit existing idmaps.
Misconfiguration can impact system operation.
{{< /hint >}}

## Idmap Widget

The **Idmap** widget in the **Advanced Settings** on the **Directory Services** screen displays idmaps added to SCALE.

![IdmapSCALE](/images/SCALE/Credentials/IdmapSCALE.png "Idmap Widget")

**Add** opens the **Add Idmap** configuration screen.

Click on any instance to open the **Edit Idmap** screen.

The **Idmap** widget header opens the **Idmap** screen.

## Idmap Screen

The **Idmap** screen displays a list view of idmaps configured on your SCALE system.

![IdmapScreen](/images/SCALE/Credentials/IdmapScreen.png "Idmap Screen")

**Add** opens the **Add Idmap** screen.

Click on an Idmap on the widget to open the screen for the selected idmap.

## Add and Edit IDMAP Screens

The settings on the **Add Idmap** and **Edit Idmap** change based on the selection made in both the **Name** and **Idmap Backend** fields.

### Add Idmap Screen (Default and Custom Value)

![AddIdmapDefaultScreen](/images/SCALE/Credentials/AddIdmapDefaultScreen.png "Add Idmap Default Screen")

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | (Required) Select an option from the dropdown list, **SMB - Primary Domain** or **Custom Value**. **SMB - Primary Domain** reduces the fields displayed on the **Add Idmap** screen. Selecting **Custom Value** adds The **Custom Name** field. |
| **Custom Name** | Displays below the **Name** field after selecting **Custom Value** in the **Name** field. Enter the pre-Windows 2000 domain name. |
| **Idmap Backend**  |(Required) Select the backend plugin interface for Winbind to use to store SID to UID/GID mapping tables. The correct setting depends on the environment you deployed the NAS in. Options are **AD** for Active Directory, **LDAP** for an LDAP environment. **AUTORID** is similar to RID but it can automatically assign IDs for different domains. **NSS** provides a means to map Unix users and groups to Windows accounts. **RFC2307** provides a way for Winbind to read ID mappings from records in an LDAP server defined in RFC 2307. **RID** provides a way to use an algorithmic mapping scheme to map UIDs/GIDs and SIDs. **TDB** is similar to RID but it is an allocating backend, which means it needs to allocate new users and group IDs in order to create new mappings. The selected option changes the settings displayed on the **Add Idmap** screen. |
| **DNS Domain Name**  | Enter the DNS name of the domain. |
| **Range Low** |(Required) Enter a value for the least number of members. Works with the **Range High** to establish the range of UID/GID numbers the Idmap backend translates. If an external credential like a Windows SID maps to a UID or GID number outside this range, TrueNAS ignores it. |
| **Range High**  | (Required) Enter a value for the greatest number of members. Works with the **Range Low** to establish the range of UID/GID numbers the Idmap backend translates. If an external credential like a Windows SID maps to a UID or GID number outside this range, TrueNAS ignores it. |
{{< /truetable >}}

**Options Settings**
The **Options** settings change based on the selected **Name** and **Idmap Backend** fields.

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------|
| **Unix Primary Group** | Select to fetch the primary group membership from the LDAP attributes (gidNumber). If unselected, the primary group membership is calculated via the primaryGroupID LDAP attribute. |
| **Unix NSS Info** | Select sets Winbind to retrieve the login shell and home directory from the LDAP attributes. If unselected, when the AD LDAP entry lacks the SFU attributes the smb4.conf parameters `template shell` and `template homedir` are used. |
{{< /truetable >}}

{{< hint type=important >}}
Support for LDAP **Schema Mode** for SMB shares is deprecated in TrueNAS 22.02 (Angelfish) and removed in 24.10 (Electric Eel).
Before updating to 24.10 or later, Administrators using this legacy feature should stop using SMB shares (continue using LDAP), convert directory users to local TrueNAS accounts (stop using LDAP), or convert to Active Directory (stop using LDAP).
