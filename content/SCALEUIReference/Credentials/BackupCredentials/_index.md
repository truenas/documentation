TrueNAS stores cloud backup services credentials, SSH connections, and SSH key pairs configured using the widgets on the **Backup Credentials** screen.
Users can set up backup credentials with cloud and SSH clients to back up data in case of drive failure.

The **Backup Credentials** screen displays the **Cloud Credentials**, **SSH Connections**, and **SSH Keypairs** widgets.

Click **Add** on the widget for the type of credential to add to open that configuration screen.
