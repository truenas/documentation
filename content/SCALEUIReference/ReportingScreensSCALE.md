The **Reporting** screen displays graphs of system information for CPU, disk, memory, network, system functions, UPS, and ZF.
Use the dropdown in the upper right corner to select between reporting graph display options.
The **CPU** report displays by default.

{{< include file="static/includes/netdatareporting.md" >}}

To configure a third-party reporting integration, such as Graphite, click **Exporters** to open the [**Reporting Exporters**](#reporting-exporters-screen) screen.

## Report Graphs

The following sections provide examples of each report graph.
There are a few controls to change the default graph view:

* The **Auto Refresh** toggle updates the graphs with the latest reporting data every few seconds.
  When active, the graph resets to the chosen **Reset Zoom** view every time the reporting data updates.
  Disable **Auto Refresh** before manually zooming in on any section of the graph.

* **Step Back** (<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:rewind"></span>) moves the graph backward in time by whatever time increment is currently active in **Reset Zoom**.

* **Step Forward** (<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:fast-forward"></span>) moves the graph forward in time by whatever time increment is currently active in **Reset Zoom**.
  The default graph view is to show the latest data, which disables this button.

* **Zoom Out** (<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:zoom-out"></span>) adjusts the time period shown in the graph between 1 Hour, 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, and 6 Month views.

* The **Reset Zoom** indicator shows which time value is active for the graph.
  The default **1 Hour** is the default (and minimum) time period that can be active.
  When **Zoom Out** is active, click **Reset Zoom** to reset the graph view to **1 Hour**.

* **Zoom In** (<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:zoom-in"></span>) adjusts the time period shown in the graph between 1 Hour, 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, and 6 Month views.
  This is active when the graph changes from the default 1 Hour view.

To manually adjust the vertical or horizontal precision of the graph, disable **Auto Refresh**, then click and drag within the graph view.
A left-to-right (or vice-versa) motion increases the horizontal view precision, while an up-to-down (or vice-versa) motion increases the vertical precision.

### CPU Graphs

Shows the CPU temperature, CPU usage, and system load graphs.
CPU graphs show the amount of time the CPU spends in various states such as executing user code, executing system code, and idle time.
Graphs show short-, mid-, and long-term loads, along with CPU temperature graphs.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/CPUReportingSystemLoad.png" alt="CPU Reporting System Load" id="CPU Reporting System Load" >}}

### Disk Graphs

Shows graphs for each selected system disk, and by report type.
Disk graphs show read and write statistics on I/O, percent busy, latency, operations per second, pending I/O requests, and disk temperature.

Use the **Select Disks** dropdown to select the disks.
Use the **Select Reports** dropdown to select the report types to display.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/DiskReportingIO.png" alt="Disks Reporting I/O" id="Disks Reporting I/O" >}}

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/DiskReportingTemperature.png" alt="Disks Reporting Temperature" id="Disks Reporting Temperature" >}}

{{< expand "Disk Report Setting Options" "v" >}}
{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Select All** | Displays all available graphs for any or all disks selected on the **Disks** dropdown list. |
| **Disk Temperature** | Displays the minimum, maximum, and mean temperature readings for the disk selected. |
| **Disk I/O** | Displays the disk read and write I/O stats in bytes/s. |
{{< /truetable >}}

{{< hint type=important >}}
Temperature monitoring for the disk is disabled if **HDD Standby** is enabled.
Check the **Storage > Disks** **Edit Disk*** configuration form for any or all disks in the system if you do not see the temperature monitoring graph.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint type=note >}}
Large petabyte systems might report storage numbers inaccurately. Storage configurations with more than 9,007,199,254,740,992 bytes round the last 4 digits.

For example, a system with 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 bytes reports the number as 18,446,744,073,709,552,000 bytes.

### Memory Graphs

Shows both the **Physical memory utilization** and **Swap utilization** graphs.
Memory graphs show memory usage and swap graphs show the amount of free and used swap space.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/MemoryReportingPhysSwap.png" alt="Memory Reporting" id="Memory Reporting" >}}

### Network Graphs

Shows an **Interface Traffic** graph for each interface in the system.
Network graphs report received and transmitted traffic in megabytes per second for each configured interface.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/NetworkReportingIntTraffic.png" alt="Network Reporting" id="Network Reporting" >}}

### System Graphs

Shows both the **Processes** and **Uptime** graphs.
System graphs show the number of processes grouped by state, sleeping, running, stopped, zombies and blocked, and system uptime.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/SystemReportingProcessUptime.png" alt="System Reporting" id="System Reporting" >}}

### UPS Graphs

Shows the UPS charging percentage, UPS runtime, UPS voltage for battery, input, and output, UPS input current, frequency, and input load, and UPS temperature.

The UPS service must be [configured]({{< relref "upsservicesscale.md" >}}) with a compatible Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) device.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/UPSReportingChargingRuntime.png" alt="UPS Reporting" id="UPS Reporting" >}}

### ZFS Graphs

Shows graphs of the ARC size, hit ratio, ARC requests demand_data, demand_metadata, prefetch_data, and prefetch_metadata with the Arc and L2 gigabytes and hits (%), and the hits, misses, and total number of requests.
ZFS graphs show compressed physical ARC size, hit ratio, demand data, demand metadata, and prefetch data and metadata.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/ZFSReportingActualHitsHitsRate.png" alt="ZFS ARC Actual Cache Hits Rate and ARC Hit Rate" id="ZFS ARC Actual Cache Hits Rate and ARC Hit Rate" >}}
{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/ZFSReportingARCSizeResult.png" alt="ZFS ARC Size and ARC Result" id="ZFS ARC Size and ARC Result" >}}

## Reporting Exporters Screen

**Exporter** on the **Reporting** screen opens the **Reporting Exporter** screen.
The **Reporting Exporters** screen shows reporting exporters configured on the system.

Exporting enables TrueNAS to send reporting metrics to another time-series database.
Exporters send reporting records as JSON objects to third-party reporting collection cloud services or applications installed on servers.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/ReportingExportersScreen.png" alt="Reporting Exporters Screen" id="Reporting Exporters Screen" >}}

**Add** opens the **Add Reporting Exporter** screen.

### Add Reporting Exporter

Use the **Add Reporting Exporter** screen to configure third-party reporting integrations.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/AddReportingExporter.png" alt="Add Reporting Exporter" id="Add Reporting Exporter" >}}

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Enter a unique name for the exporter configuration. If configuring multiple instances, give each a distinct name. |
| **Type** | Select the report object format. At present, **GRAPHITE** is the only current supported option. Selecting **GRAPHITE** displays the exporter configuration settings |
| **Enable** | Select to enable sending reporting data to the configured exporter. Leave the checkbox clear to disable the explorer without removing the configuration. |
{{< /truetable >}}

Additional settings populate based on the selected **Type** option.

#### Graphite Settings
