The **Pool Creation Wizard** configuration screens include a configuration preview and an inventory list of disks available on the system.

**Create Pool** at the top right of the **Storage Dashboard** screen opens the **Pool Creation Wizard**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizard.png" alt="Pool Creation Wizard" id="Pool Creation Wizard" >}}

**Configuration Preview** lists pool and VDEV settings that dynamically update as you configure settings in the wizard.

**Inventory** displays the number of available disks by size on the system, and this list dynamically updates as disks move to VDEVs added in the wizard.

## Pool Creation Wizard
The **Pool Creation Wizard** for most systems has seven configuration screens, numbered in sequence, to create a pool with VDEVs.
{{< enterprise>}}
Larger iXsystems-provided servers for Enterprise users equipped with expansion shelves include the additional [**Enclosure Options**](#enclosure-options) screen.
{{< /enterprise >}}

Each wizard VDEV configuration screen includes the **Automated Disk Selection** and **Advanced Options** areas.
Click **Manual Disk Selection** to open the **[Manual Selection](#manual-selection-screen)** screen.

**Back** and **Next** move to the previous or next wizard screen.
**Reset Step** clears the VDEV settings for the VDEV type selected. For example, **Data** VDEV configuration.
**Save And Go To Review** saves the current selections and goes directly to the **Review** wizard screen.

### General Info
The **General Info** area includes two default settings, **Name** and **Encryption**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardGeneralInfo.png" alt="Pool Creation Wizard General Info" id="Pool Creation Wizard General Info" >}}

**Name** is a required field. 
Enter a pool name of up to 50 characters in length that follows [ZFS naming conventions](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1448/gbcpt.html).
Use lower-case alpha characters to avoid potential problems with sharing protocols.
Names can include numbers and special characters such as underscore (_), hyphen (-), colon (:), or a period (.).

**Encryption** applies key-type encryption to the pool.
Select to enable [ZFS encryption](https://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.3/man8/zfs.8.html) for the pool and all datasets (or zvols) created within the pool.
See [Storage Encryption]({{< relref "EncryptionScale.md" >}}) for more information on using SCALE storage encryption.
An encryption warning dialog displays with a **Confirm** checkbox.
Select to enable the **I Understand** button. **I Understand** allows you to continue adding the pool with encryption applied.

{{< hint type="Warning" >}}
Applying encryption at the pool level also encrypts all datasets (and zvols) within the pool.

Keep the encryption key file in a safe location where you perform regular backups. Losing the encryption key file results in lost data you cannot recover.
{{< /hint >}}

If system disks contain data exported from pools, a warning displays with a checkbox for the pool name.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardGenInfoExportedPool.png" alt="General Info With Exported Pools" id="General Info with Exported Pools" >}}

If system disks have non-unique serial numbers, a warning displays with additional fields.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardGenInfoNonUniqueSerialNums.png" alt="Non-Unique Serial Numbers Screen" id="Non-Unique Serial Numbers Screen" >}}

**Allow non-unique serialed disks** has two radio buttons, **Allow** and **Don't Allow**.

**Allow** permits using disks with non-unique serial numbers, such as those that can occur on virtual disks, and displays them as available disks on the **Data** wizard screen.
**Don't Allow** does not permit using disks with non-unique serial numbers.

### Enclosure Options
The **Enclosure Options** screen shows in the **Pool Creation Wizard** if the iXsystems hardware includes one or more expansion shelves.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardEnclosureOptionsScreen.png" alt="Pool Creation Wizard Enclosure Options" id="Pool Creation Wizard Enclosure Options" >}}

The **Enclosure Options** screen shows three radio buttons that could apply a set pool storage configuration topology when using the **Automated Disk Selection** option to assign disks to a VDEV.

* **No Enclosure Dispersal Strategy** does not apply a dispersal strategy in how the system adds disks by size and type to the pool VDEVs created when using the **Automated Disk Selection** option.
  Does not show additional options. Disks added to the pool VDEVs are assigned in sequence based on disk availability and are not balanced across all enclosures.
* **Maximum Dispersal Strategy** applies a maximum dispersal strategy in how the system adds disks by size and type to the pool VDEVs created when using the **Automated Disk Selection** option.
  This balances disk selection across all enclosures and available disks.
  Does not show additional options. Disks added to the pool VDEVs are spread across all available enclosure disks.
* **Limit Pool To A Single Enclosure** applies a minimum dispersal strategy in how the system adds disks by size and type to the pool VDEVs created when using the **Automated Disk Selection** option.
  Shows the **Enclosure** dropdown with a list of available expansion shelf options. Disks added to the pool VDEVs are spread across the enclosure disks that align with the selection in **Enclosure**.

### Data Screen
The **Data** wizard screen includes the option to automatically or manually add disks to a data VDEV.
You must add a data VDEV before you can add other types of VDEVs to the pool.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardDataScreen.png" alt="Pool Creation Wizard Data Screen" id="Pool Creation Wizard Data Screen" >}}

{{< expand "Common Pool Creation Wizard Settings" "v" >}}
The **Layout** dropdown list shows the **Stripe**, **Mirror**, **RAIDZ1**, **RAIDZ2**, **RAIDZ3**, **dRAID1**, **dRAID2**, and **dRAID3** VDEV types on the **Data** wizard screens.

{{< include file="/static/includes/PoolCreationWizardCommonSettings.md" >}}
{{< /expand >}}

### Log (Optional)
Use the **Log** wizard screen to configure a log VDEV. ZFS log devices can improve the speeds of synchronous writes.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardLogScreen.png" alt="Pool Creation Wizard Log Screen" id="Pool Creation Wizard Log Screen" >}}

{{< include file="/static/includes/PoolCreationWizardCommonSettings.md" >}}
{{< /expand >}}

### Advanced Options
The **Manual Selection** screen allows adding a **Stripe** or the **Data** VDEV **Layout**, then selecting individual disks to add to the new VDEV.
You can filter disks by type or size.

**Add** places a VDEV area to populate with individual disks.

The screen shows disk icons for available disks, or click on the system field to expand the dropdown list to show a list of available system disks.
You can use the disk filters separately or together to find disks of the same type and size.
Drag disks to the VDEV to add them.

**Save Selection** creates the VDEV and closes the window.
