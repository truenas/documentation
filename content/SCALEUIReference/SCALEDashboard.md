The **Dashboard** is the first screen you see after logging into the web interface after installing SCALE.
It displays a set of default widgets with system, help, storage, and network information, but you can customize the display to suit your needs and preferences.
**Dashboard** on the left side navigation panel returns to the main dashboard from any other screen in the UI.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Dashboard/DashboardMainScreen.png" alt="TrueNAS SCALE Dashboard" id="TrueNAS SCALE Dashboard" >}}

The **Configure** button at the top right of the **Dashboard** changes the screen to [configuration mode](#dashboard-in-configuration-mode) and allows you to turn widget displays on or off.

## Dashboard Widgets
The **Dashboard** widgets show information about the TrueNAS system basic settings, CPU and memory usage, network traffic and link status, storage, and backup tasks.
Dashboard widgets are customizable. Options include changing which widgets layouts and the location on the screen, and adding custom or application widgets.

Pool and network interface widgets vary based on storage and network configurations on the system.

Click on the <span class="iconify" data-icon="ic:baseline-assessment"></span> **Reports** icon to display the data report screen that corresponds to the widget category.
For example, clicking the <span class="iconify" data-icon="ic:baseline-assessment"></span> assessment icon on the **CPU** widget opens the **Reporting > CPU** screen. 

{{< expand "System Information Widget" "v" >}} 
The **System Information** widget shows general information about the SCALE system.
The **Updates Available** button opens the **System > Update** screen.

### Widget Group Areas
Widget groups (areas) can use one of five layouts that consist of other widgets of different sizes and configurations.
Layouts options show on the [**Widget Editor**](#widget-editor) screen.

Each grouping area shows three function icons:

Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> allows selecting the next button or function icon on the screen and across all widget groups.

## Widget Editor
Access to the **Widget Editor** screen is available when the **Dashboard** screen is in configuration mode.
The edit icon for any widget group opens the **Widget Editor** populated with the current settings for that widget group.
**Add** opens the **Widget Editor** with no settings.
