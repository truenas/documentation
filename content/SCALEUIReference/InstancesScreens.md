### Idmap Widget

(Containers Only) The **Idmap** widget shows the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) mappings used by the instance to translate IDs between the host and the container or VM.
It provides details such as the **Host ID**, **Maprange**, and **NS ID** for both UIDs and GIDs.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/IdmapWidget.png" alt="Idmap Widget" id="Idmap Widget" >}}

* **Host ID** shows the starting ID used by the host for mapping to the instance IDs.
* **Maprange** indicates the range of IDs that the host allocates for the instance.
* **NS ID** represents the namespace ID used for the mapping.

For example, if the **Host ID** is `2147000001` and the **Maprange** is `458752`, the container UID 0 (root) is mapped to the host UID `2147000001`.
This ensures proper isolation and user/group identity management between the host and the instance.

### Tools Widget

The **Tools** widget provides quick access to various tools and utilities for managing your instance.
You can open a shell, console, or VNC session directly from this widget.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/ToolsWidget.png" alt="Tools Widget - VM" id="Tools Widget" >}}

**Shell** opens an **Instance Shell** session for interacting with the instance.
  
**Console** (VM only) opens an **Instance Console** session for accessing the instance’s system console.

**VNC** (VM only) opens a VNC connection using your preferred client.
It uses a VNC URL scheme (for example, `vnc://hostname.domain.com:5930`) to launch the session directly in the application.
If your environment does not support VNC URLs, you can manually connect using a VNC client by entering the host name or IP address followed by the port number without `vnc://` (for example, `hostname.domain.com:5930` or `IP:5930`).

### Metrics Widget

The **Metrics** widget displays real-time graphs that monitor instance performance, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk I/O pressure.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/MetricsWidget.png" alt="Metrics Widget" id="Metrics Widget" >}}

**CPU (%)** shows the percentage of CPU usage over time.
  
**Memory (MiB)** displays the memory usage in MiB over time.

**Disk I/O Full Pressure (%)** tracks the disk input/output pressure as a percentage over time.

## Edit Instance Screen

## Add PCI Passthrough Device Screen

The **Add PCI Passthrough Device** screen lists the available physical PCI devices that can be attached to an instance.

PCI passthrough assigns a physical PCI device, such as a network card or GPU, directly to a VM, allowing it to function as if physically attached.

The selected PCI device(s) must not be in use by the host or share an IOMMU group with any device the host requires.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Virtualization/AddPCIPassthroughDevice.png" alt="Add PCI Passthrough Device Screen" id="Add PCI Passthrough Device Screen" >}}

Use **Search Devices** or the **Type** dropdown to filter available devices, enter device type or a label.

**Select** attaches the selected device.
