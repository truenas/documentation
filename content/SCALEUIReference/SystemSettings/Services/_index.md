**System > Services** displays each system component that runs continuously in the background. These typically control data-sharing or other external access to the system. Individual services have configuration screens and activation toggles, and you can set them to run automatically.

The <span class="material-icons">edit</span> **Configure** icon opens the service configuration screen.

The **NFS** service row has one additional <span class="iconify" data-icon="material-symbols:list"></span> **NFS Sessions** icon that opens the [**NFS Sessions** screen]({{< relref "NFSSharesScreens.md" >}}).

The **SMB** service row has two additional icons that link to other screens:
* <span class="iconify" data-icon="material-symbols:receipt-long"></span> **Audit Logs** opens the **Audit** screen.
* <span class="iconify" data-icon="material-symbols:list"></span> **SMB Sessions** opens the [**SMB Status** screen]({{< relref "SMBSharesScreens.md" >}}).

Select **Start Automatically** to set the service to start after the system reboots.

Click on the **Running** toggle to start the service or to stop it if it is running. Stop services before changing configuration settings.
