TrueCommand allows you to manage all your TrueNAS systems from one location. This multi-system management increases efficiency and simplifies operations.

## Getting Started
After creating the administrator account the first time you log into TrueCommand, you can get started with the initial TrueCommand configuration:

1. Configure TrueCommand Settings (described in this article).
2. [Connect your first TrueNAS system]({{< ref "/TCGettingStarted/ConnectingTrueNAS" >}}).
3. [Create user accounts]({{< ref "/TCGettingStarted/UserAccounts" >}}).
4. Review the [Interface Overview]({{< ref "/TCGettingStarted/InterfaceOverview" >}}) article to become familiar with the interface dashboards, toolbars and icons, and navigation.
