TrueCommand supports creating additional user accounts that can log in to the web interface and use some TrueCommand features.
After [getting started with TrueCommand]({{< ref "/TCGettingStarted/" >}}), these non-administrator user accounts have limited access to configuring TrueCommand, but generally can interact with connected TrueNAS systems.
Administrator accounts also have full access to these features.

This guide reviews screens that are generally available to both kinds of TrueCommand accounts and provides guidance for using these TrueCommand features.

To read about settings that are available to a TrueCommand administrator account, see the related [Administrator Guide]({{< ref "/AdminGuide/" >}}).
