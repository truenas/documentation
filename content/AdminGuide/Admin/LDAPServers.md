Users can configure TrueCommand to use LDAP servers for security and authentication management among connected TrueNAS systems.

## Add an LDAP Server in TrueCommand

Click the gear icon in the upper toolbar and select **Administration**. Scroll down to the **LDAP Servers** widget and click **ADD**.

![AddLDAPServer](/images/TrueCommand/Administration/AddLDAPServerScreen.png "Add LDAP Servers")

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hostname** | Host name of LDAP/AD server, with optional port. e.g. example.com:636. |
| **Domain** | LDAP base domain. e.g. dc=example,dc=com. |
| **Group Search Domain** | Optional for admins who want to avoid issues with unwanted groups by forcing group searches to start at a deeper domain. |
| **User ID Field** | Class mapped to login username. The default is uid. |
| **Group ID Field** | Class for finding groups associated with a user. The default is cn. |
| **BIND User Domain** | Full user domain for binding before finding user fully qualified ID (FQID). Optional. |
| **BIND Password** | If the bind user is set, use this password when performing a simple bind on user search. |
| **Realm** | The realm that performs authentication against the LDAP server. |
| **KDC** | The Kerberos Key Distribution Center that supplies session tickets and temporary session keys to users and computers within the LDAP server. |
| **Enable SSL** | Enable LDAPS/TLS connection. Uses the globally configured verification settings. |

After you fill the form according to your server, click **ADD SERVER**.

Click **CONFIGURE** in the **Configuration** widget and enable **Allow LDAP user creation**, then click **SAVE**.

## Updating the LDAP Server

TrueCommand only checks for usernames, passwords, and groups while authenticating LDAP credentials.
You can add entries for email, phone number, or URLs, but TrueCommand does not check for them.

The LDAP server uses an LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) file to add or modify entries in the server.

For more in-depth LDAP configuration methods, see this [LDAP System Administration](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ldap-system-administration/1565924916/ch04s05.html) guide.

### Add New Entries to the Directory

Enter the following command to add entries to the LDIF file. Separate specifications (cn, dc, etc.) with a comma. 

```
$ ldapmodify -D "uid=USER,dc=DOMAIN,dc=DOMAIN" -w secret \
> -x -a -f /tmp/users.ldif
```

`USER` is the user ID.
`DOMAIN` is a domain component like com, edu, org, etc.

If the command succeeds, you will see an output like this:

`adding new entry "uid=USER,dc=DOMAIN,dc=DOMAIN"`

### Modify Entries on the Directory

If, for instance, the user you added does not yet have a password, you can add it with the following command.

```
dn: uid=USER,dc=DOMAIN,dc=DOMAIN"
changetype: modify
add: password
password: USER@DOMAIN.DOMAIN
```

### LDAP Groups

For finding associated groups, TrueCommand looks for `groupOfUniqueNames`, `groupOfNames`, `posixGroup`, and `Group` object classes and users matching the `uniquemember`, `member`, `owner`, or `memberUid` attributes.

Teams configured under **LDAP Default Teams** are added to new users automatically, while group names can be mapped to one or more teams under **LDAP Group Mappings**.

### Troubleshooting

The two most prominent error codes for LDAP are 254 (connection failure) and 49 (invalid credentials).
In the event of a connection failure, ensure **Enable SSL** is set when only LDAPS is available.

For credential failures, ensure the right authentication mode, either BIND Password or Kerberos, is enabled.
When Kerberos is enabled, its use is preferred.

When password servers are required, move the autogenerated **krb5.conf** within the container from `/etc/krb5.conf` to `/data` and enable its use by setting `--env KRB5_CONFIG=/data/krb5.conf` on a new container run.
See the Middleware log for further debugging.
Some AD servers require manual SASL settings to avoid an "illegal packet length" error by setting the environment variable `--env LDAPSASL_SECPROPS=minssf=0,maxssf=0` to disable security factor limitations.
Other **ldap.conf** settings can be configured this way, or setting the LDAPCONF environment variable to `/data/ldap.conf` and writing a custom conf there.

TrueCommand sets `TLS_REQCERT` and `TLS_REQSAN` to **allow** or **demand** depending on global TLS settings, as well as TLS_CERT and TLS_KEY to the MW managed self-signed certificate in `/data/truecommand`.
