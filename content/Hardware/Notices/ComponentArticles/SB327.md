Due to changes in California law with [SB-327](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327), the way iXsystems hardware uses IPMI credentials has changed.

## Randomized Passwords (SB-327 Compliant)

* Username: `ADMIN`.
* X-Series `ipmitool` username: `admin`.

The randomized password is printed on a sticker and placed on the purchased system (typically on the back).
Customers purchasing Enterprise-level hardware can also find the password on the Asset List included with their shipment.
If neither location has this password, please contact iXsystems Support.

{{< hint type=note >}}
Connecting to an X-Series system with a direct Serial Console connection still uses these credentials:

* Username: `sysadmin`
* Password: `superuser`

## Prior to SB-327

{{< hint type=note >}}
The previous default credentials can vary by system "family".
They are listed here as a historical reference for customers that received a system prior to SB-327 implementation.

TrueNAS Mini models, including the discontinued E+, used these default credentials:

**Mini E and Mini X:**

X-Series systems (X10 and X20) had two sets of default credentials:

These credentials applied to both generations of M-Series systems and each model (M40, M50, and M60):

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "R-Series" >}}

These credentials applied to each R-Series model (R10, R20, R20A, R40, R50):
