Due to changes in California law with [SB-327](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327), the way iXsystems hardware uses IPMI credentials has changed.

### Prior to SB-327

The previous default credentials can vary by system "family":

{{< tabs "Previous Credentials" >}}
{{< tab "TrueNAS Minis" >}}
TrueNAS Mini models, including the discontinued E+, used these default credentials:

**Mini E and Mini X:**

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin`

**Mini E+, X+, and XL+:**

* Username: `ADMIN`
* Password: `ADMIN`

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "X-Series" >}}

X-Series systems (X10 and X20) had two sets of default credentials:

1. Direct Serial Console connections:
   * Username: `sysadmin`
   * Password: `superuser`
2. IPMI connections using `ipmitool`:
   * Username: `admin`
   * Password: `admin`

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "M-Series" >}}

These credentials applied to both generations of M-Series systems and each model (M40, M50, and M60):

* Username: `ADMIN`
* Password: `ADMIN`

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "R-Series" >}}

These credentials applied to each R-Series model (R10, R20, R20A, R40, R50):

* Username: `ADMIN`
* Password: `ADMIN`

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### After SB-327

The username is `ADMIN`.
X-Series systems use `admin`.
The random password is listed in the Basic Setup Guide included with the purchased TrueNAS Hardware and on a sticker applied to the back of the system.
If neither location has this password, contact iXsystems Support.
