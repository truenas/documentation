## FreeNAS Mini Motherboard Clock Signal Issue

iXsystems is aware of an issue with a component on the motherboard in the second generation FreeNAS Mini and FreeNAS Mini XL. In most cases, your FreeNAS Mini will perform normally and may never be impacted by this issue. However, based on information that we have gathered from our vendors, customers, and our engineering team, a small number of these boards may experience issues after 18 months in operation. If the affected component does fail, the system will fail to boot. For more information about the issue and our plan to address it, please read below.

**Is the data in my FreeNAS Mini safe?**

Don’t worry! This issue only affects the FreeNAS Mini motherboard and should not cause any loss of data or affect your storage disks.

**Is this issue dangerous?**

No. The affected system will simply fail to boot. It is not related to overheating, or other hazardous types of damage.

**Is this issue specific to the FreeNAS Mini?**

No. Many vendors use this manufacturer’s component and have reported the same issue.

**Which models of the FreeNAS Mini are affected?**

This issue affects only the second generation of the FreeNAS Mini and FreeNAS Mini XL. The first generation of the FreeNAS Mini is not affected by this issue.

**How do I know which generation of the FreeNAS Mini I have?**

To identify if you have a second generation FreeNAS Mini or a first generation FreeNAS Mini,  use the following information. Second generation FreeNAS Minis will have a FreeNAS badge on the front of the case and a lock immediately to the right. Another way to tell is by looking at the USB ports. The first generation FreeNAS Mini will have front USB ports visible on the front of the machine. On the second generation FreeNAS Mini, the front USB ports are hidden behind the lockable door.

**Will iXsystems replace my FreeNAS Mini motherboard under warranty if I experience this issue? What if my warranty is expired?**

iXsystems is proud to stand behind its products. We’re extending the warranty on all second generation FreeNAS Mini motherboards shipped before February 2017 to a total of three (3) years. Any FreeNAS Minis shipped in February and after will have our standard one year warranty and are completely free of this issue.
