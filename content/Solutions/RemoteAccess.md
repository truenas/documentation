## Overview

TrueNAS is fundamentally a storage appliance, so we recommend that you always run it not directly exposed to the internet.

However, there are many instances where a user needs to access their storage data or services remotely. 
In most corporate environments, a corporate VPN service controls internal and external access, performs proper auditing, and applies and enforces security best practices. 
For the small business or home lab, where a corporate VPN is not an option, you can choose from many easy-to-deploy and manage services that give you or your clients access to your storage services and applications. 
This guide introduces several access options and provides a basic walk-through enabling remote access to your TrueNAS.

In TrueNAS 24.10 and later, there are several VPN technologies to choose from, each with strengths and weaknesses that make them suitable for particular environments. 
This guide focuses on three options available through the TrueNAS App catalog for rapid deployment. 

- Tailscale

- ZeroTier

- Wireguard
