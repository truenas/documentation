## Overview

TrueNAS is fundamentally a storage appliance, and as such it is recommended to always be run not directly exposed to the internet.

However, there are many instances in which a user will need to access their storage data or services remotely. In most corporate
environments this is controlled by having access to a corporate VPN service where proper auditing and security best practices
can be enforced. For the small business or home lab where a corporate VPN isn't available, there are many easier to deploy and
manage services that can be used to give yourself or your clients access to your storage services and applications. This guide
will introduce you to several of these and provide a basic walk-through of how to enable remote access to your TrueNAS.

In TrueNAS 24.10 and later, there are several VPN technologies to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses that
may make them suitable for your particular environment. We will focus on three of them, all of which are available via the 
TrueNAS App catalog for rapid deployment.
