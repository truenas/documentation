There is an unsupported, open source driver for Cinder available for TrueNAS, available at https://github.com/iXsystems/cinder.
This is a simple driver that uses several scripts to allow block/iSCSI interactions between OpenStack Cinder and TrueNAS systems.
To review the driver documentation, including minimum hardware requirements, install instructions, and basic usage, see https://github.com/iXsystems/cinder/blob/master/README.md.
