## Using Virtualized TrueNAS 13.0 with Amazon Web Services (AWS)

These instructions demonstrate how to create a virtualized TrueNAS image on FreeBSD, configure it with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and access the TrueNAS web interface.
There are a few things that must be prepared before building the image.

The FreeBSD system needs two applications to create, configure, and upload the virtual machine image: [bhyve](https://bhyve.org/) and [bsdec2-image-upload](https://www.freshports.org/net/bsdec2-image-upload/).
The most recent version (>=1.3.1) of *bsdec2-image-upload* is required, otherwise an SSL error occurs when attempting to upload the image.
If not available on the ports tree, the utility is available from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cperciva/bsdec2-image-upload).

Currently, *bsdec2-image-upload* fails on images that aren't 10GB.
An issue has been created, but in the meantime a workaround is to edit <file>main.c</file> and replace:

```
"BlockDeviceMapping.1.Ebs.VolumeSize=10&"
```
with

```
"BlockDeviceMapping.1.Ebs.VolumeSize=16&"
```

To build, use a FreeBSD system with either *libressl-devel* or *openssl-devel*, as well as *ca_root_nss*, and run `make install`.

Create an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=default&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start) with an [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html).
Record the region associated with the S3 bucket.
Set the bucket lifetime policy to delete data after 1 day, as *bsdec2-image-upload* does not delete files from S3 and the files are no longer needed after the AMI is registered.
A [user with permissions to EC2 and S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) is must have these permissions:

```
s3:PutObject
s3:GetObject
ec2:RegisterImage
ec2:DescribeImages
s3:DeleteObject
ec2:ImportVolume
ec2:DescribeConverstionTasks
ec2:CreateSnapshot
ec2:DescribeSnapshots
ec2:DeleteVolume
ec2:DescribeRegions
ec2:CopyImage
ec2:ModifyImageAttribute
```
Alternatively, give full access to S3 and EC2.

After creating the IAM user, download an [Access Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) to the working directory on the FreeBSD system.
The file has these lines:

```
Access key ID,Secret access key
{ACCESS_KEY},{SECRET}
```

Open a new file called <file>KEY.pem</file> and copy the information contained in the <file>csv</file> file:

```
ACCESS_KEY_ID={ACCESS_KEY}
ACCESS_KEY_SECRET={SECRET}
```

### Create TrueNAS Image

When all the prerequisites are ready, download a TrueNAS 11.2 or later [.iso file](https://www.freenas.org/download-freenas-release/).
Open a shell and go to your local working directory.
Create an empty raw image file with `truncate -s 16G {TRUENAS}.img`.
Replace *{TRUENAS}* with a image file name.
This empty image is the installation target for the TrueNAS <file>.iso</file>.

Next, load the virtualization module and create a tap and bridge interface:

```
kldload -n vmm
ifconfig tap0 create
sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
ifconfig bridge0 create
ifconfig bridge0 addm re0 addm tap0
ifconfig bridge0 up
```

Use `bhyveload -m 4GB -d truenas.img vm0` to load the image into the hypervisor and create virtual machine *vm0* with four gigabytes of memory.

To install TrueNAS into the image, load both the image and TrueNAS <file>.iso</file> file into bhyve: `bhyve -c 2 -m 4G -H -A -P -g 0 -s 0,hostbridge -s 1,lpc -s 2,virtio-net,tap0 -s 3,virtio-blk,{TRUENAS}.img -s 31,ahci-cd,{TRUENAS-VERSION}.iso -l com1,stdio vm0`.
Replace *{TRUENAS}* with the name of the image file and *{TRUENAS-VERSION}* with the TrueNAS <file>.iso</file> file name.

{{< expand "The commands failed?" "v" >}}
If these commands fail, for instance an error concerning <file>boot.lua</file>, then try this command which uses a combines the two previous commands in a shell script included in the bhyve installation.

```
sh /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh -c 2 -m 4GB -t tap0 -d {TRUENAS}.img -i -I {TRUENAS-VERSION}.iso vm0
```
{{< /expand >}}

When the TrueNAS installer opens, make sure *boot with BIOS* is chosen and start the installation.
Power off the device when the installation is done.

{{< expand "Why can't I just reboot?" "v" >}}
Do not load the completed image into bhyve and boot after installation as TrueNAS will create invalid network settings.
If network issues occur, boot the image and create a DHCP interface manually named `xn0`.

### Upload TrueNAS Image to EC2

Now that the image is created and configured, upload it to EC2.
Use `bsdec2-image-upload` with the image file: `bsdec2-image-upload --public {TRUENAS}.img TrueNAS {description} {region} {S3 bucket} KEY.pem`.
Replace *{TRUENAS}* with the image file name, *{description}* with a unique identifier for the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), *{region}* with your [Amazon region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html), and *{S3 bucket}* with your AWS image storage location.
<file>KEY.pem</file> is the IAM user access key that was downloaded earlier.
These elements are required for the upload to start.

`bsdec2-image-upload` sends the image to the AWS bucket in *10 MiB* segments.
The upload can take several hours, depending on connection speeds and other factors.

When the S3 bucket upload completes, the script creates a snapshot, registers the AMI, and copies the AMI to all regions for mirrors.

{{< expand "The upload command failed?" "v" >}}
The upload command can fail for various reasons.
For example, entering a description that already exists.
If this happens, fix the error and rerun the command.
When successful, the upload simply finishes.

### Accessing TrueNAS with the AMI

With the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) created and uploaded to AWS, an EC2 instance needs to be activated before the TrueNAS interface is accessible.
Log in to your Amazon Web Services account and click the `EC2` Compute service.

![AWSManagementConsole](/images/CORE/AWSManagementConsole.png "AWS Management Console")

Find the **Launch instance** section, open the *Launch instance* drop down, and click *Launch instance*.

![AWSEC2LaunchInstance](/images/CORE/AWSEC2LaunchInstance.png "Launching the instance")

The instance launcher follows several steps:

1. Click *My AMIs* and select the name that was uploaded by `bsdec2-image-upload`.
2. Any instance will work, but *t2.large* is recommended for TrueNAS given an 8GB memory recommendation.
3. Skip this step.
4. Add EBS volumes according to your TrueNAS use case.
   At minimum, add a couple of cold HDD volumes for a storage pool.
   General purpose SSD volumes can be used as L2ARC or SLOG devices.
5. Skip this step.
6. Add a rule with *http*. This allows you to connect to the TrueNAS web interface.
7. Review your settings and press *Launch*.

The running instance is added to the EC2 dashboard or can be seen in the **Instances** menu.
When the image has fully started, AWS performs two status checks.
The first checks for AWS uptime, and the second verifies the instance is functional.
After both checks pass, paste either the Public IP or Public DNS link in a new browser window to connect to the TrueNAS web interface.
