[vCenter Server](https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html) provides a web interface to manage physical and virtual machines.
The iXsystems TrueNAS vCenter Plugin activates management options for TrueNAS hardware attached to vCenter Server.
This enables limited TrueNAS system management from a single interface.

The TrueNAS vCenter plugin is currently compatible with VMware vCenter Server versions [**8.0**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-installation/GUID-8DC3866D-5087-40A2-8067-1361A2AF95BD.html), [**7.0**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vcenter.install.doc/GUID-8DC3866D-5087-40A2-8067-1361A2AF95BD.html), and [**6.7.0**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vcenter.install.doc/GUID-8DC3866D-5087-40A2-8067-1361A2AF95BD.html).

The vCenter plugin supports many different TrueNAS software versions installed on TrueNAS Enterprise licensed hardware:

{{< truetable >}}

{{< expand "3.3.0 (Click to expand)" "v" >}}

  **November 24, 2020**
  
  iXsystems is pleased to release version 3.3.0 of the TrueNAS vCenter plugin!
  This is a maintenance release of the plugin, designed to improve functionality and add support for TrueNAS 12.0 host systems. As part of this maintenance release, additional testing resources have been devoted to the plugin and several large-scale improvements have also been identified for future plugin versions.
    
  ### Improvement
  
  * [VCP-78](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/VCP-78) - Convert to TrueNAS API 2.0 for improved compatibility and reliability with TrueNAS 11.3 and 12.0

  ### Bug

  * [VCP-84](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/VCP-84) - vCenter plugin does not function with TrueNAS 11.3 unless the legacy API 1.0 endpoint is enabled

  ## Known Issues

  * vCenter 7.0b has issues rendering the plugin interface ([VCP-89](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/VCP-89)). This is scheduled to be resolved in a future plugin update, but it is recommended for customers to continue using vCenter 6.7-U3 or earlier with this plugin.
  * *https* has been disabled for the 3.3.0 release ([VCP-105](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/VCP-105)) due to an issue with connector initialization failures and conflicts with the Apache HTTPClient dependency. TrueNAS users *must* enable http on their TrueNAS system for the 3.3.0 plugin to connect properly! To verify TrueNAS 11.3 or 12.0 can connect, log in to the web interface, go to **System > General**, and make sure **Web Interface HTTP > HTTPS Redirect*** is unset. This issue is scheduled for resolution in [plugin version 4.0](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/projects/VCP/versions/12108).
  * The plugin replication feature has been removed due to numerous long-standing issues that could not be resolved for this version of the plugin. Continue to create replication tasks using the TrueNAS web interface.
  * Cloned datastores always use the first listed interface ([VCP-113](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/projects/VCP/issues/VCP-113)). To work around this issue, either ensure the original datastore is using the desired interface or create a new datastore instead of making a clone.
  * Plugin deployment complains about logging system error ([VCP-114](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/VCP-114)). This is a cosmetic error based on initial plugin deployments creating an empty log file. There is no impact to installing or using the vCenter Plugin.

## Using the Plugin

After being assisted with plugin deployment, using the plugin involves connecting TrueNAS hosts and configuring the various features to your use case.
The interface suspends after several minutes of inactivity and displays a warning that the interface is suspended and must be refreshed.

### Connecting TrueNAS Hosts

In a browser, go to your vCenter Server web interface, log in, and click **Menu > Global Inventory Lists > Manage TrueNAS > + Add host** to add TrueNAS hosts to vCenter.

![AddHost](/images/vCenterPlugin/AddHost.png "Options for Adding Hosts")

Fill in the required information.
A hostname or IP address can be used for the TrueNAS system.
For High Availability systems, use the VIP address or hostname to ensure the plugin remains connected in the event of a system failover.
Click **Add Host** and the TrueNAS hostname or IP address appears in the list of connected systems.

![HostList](/images/vCenterPlugin/HostList.png "Example Showing a Connected Host")

Right-click a list entry to see options to edit the host user credentials or remove that host from vCenter.
Click a hostname to see the system management options.
Clicking a system entry opens the management interface.

### System Management

The system management screen shows a summary and options to modify the system.

To modify the TrueNAS system, click **Configure**.
Each submenu has a row of buttons to add or make changes to any items in the list.
vCenter works in the background when resolving change requests.
**Refresh** updates the list to see any items that might have finished being created or modified.
Tasks in progress display in the collapsible **Recent Tasks** area across the bottom of the screen.
Naming objects in the plugin follow a standard convention.
Names can contain spaces, alphanumeric, `-`, and `.` characters.

{{< tabs "Plugin Options" >}}
{{< tab "System Summary" >}}

Click **Summary** to view basic information about this system.
The IP address, installed version of TrueNAS, storage availability, and system service status are shown.

![HostSummary](/images/vCenterPlugin/HostSummary.png "Example Summary")

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Datastores" >}}
The vCenter plugin can create two different kinds of datastores on a TrueNAS host:

* Virtual Machine File System (VMFS) for iSCSI block-level access
* Network File System (NFS) for file-level access

#### List

![DatastoreList](/images/vCenterPlugin/DatastoreList.png "Datastores List")

vCenter has a default limit of eight NFS datastores per ESX host.
See this [VMware article](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1020652) about maximum supported volumes for more details.

The list shows Datastores that have been created and are managed by the plugin.
The list does not display other types of shares created and managed through the TrueNAS web interface.

#### Add Datastore

Click **+** (Add) to create a new datastore.

![DatastoreCreate](/images/vCenterPlugin/DatastoreCreate.png "Creation Options")

Choose an ESXi host for the datastore or an ESXi cluster to spread the reserved space across multiple systems.
Clusters can be used as long as a single member of the cluster supports the datastore features.
Click **Next**.

![DatastoreCreateType](/images/vCenterPlugin/DatastoreCreateType.png "Datastore Types")

Choose the datastore type.
**VMFS** datastores provide block-level (iSCSI) storage for virtual machines.
**NFS** datastores provide file-level storage access.
Click **Next** to view specific options for each datastore type

{{< expand "VMFS Datastore Configuration" >}}
![VMFSDatastoreSettings](/images/vCenterPlugin/VMFSDatastoreSettings.png "VMFS Options")

Enter a name for the new datastore.
Enter a value and choose a unit for the **Datastore Size**.
The size must be smaller than the chosen **Volume**.
The minimum size for a VMFS datastore is 2GB.

The **Data Path IP** shows the TrueNAS system IP address.
Users can select other connected TrueNAS systems with the dropdown list.

Select the datastore from the **VMFS Version** dropdown list.
Choose between the modern version **6** or the legacy versions **3** and **5**.
See the [VMware VMFS documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/) for detailed comparisons.

Enabling **Sparse Volume** reserves less than the total available size and metadata storage space, but it can cause writing to fail if the volume has little space remaining.
See [zfs(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=zfs) for more details.

Select the TrueNAS pool to hold the datastore.
The volume must be large enough to contain the chosen datastore size.

If you have a high availability NAS with a Fibre Channel license and a network configured to form a Fibre Channel fabric with the NAS and ESXi, you are also able to select a Fibre Channel port for the datastore.

Selecting a Fibre Channel port enables that port with the datastore target on the NAS and creates a datastore with a corresponding Fibre Channel HBA on the ESXi.
One target per port is supported.

{{< /expand >}}
{{< expand "NFS Datastore Configuration" >}}
![NFSDataStoreSettings](/images/vCenterPlugin/NFSDatastoreSettings.png "NFS Options")

Enter a name for the new datastore.
The **Data Path IP** shows the TrueNAS system IP address.
Users can select other TrueNAS systems added to vCenter Server with the dropdown list.
Select the path to the TrueNAS NFS share from the **Mount Share Path** dropdown list.
Click **Next**.
{{< /expand >}}

##### Review Datastore Configuration

After configuring the VMFS or NFS datastore, vCenter shows a summary of the new datastore.
To begin creating the datastore, review the settings and click **Finish**.
The interface shows a warning when the datastore contains more than 80% of the available space.
Click **Refresh** to see the new datastore after creating it.

#### Extending a Datastore

Users needing additional space can increase the total size of a VMFS datastore.
Highlight a VMFS datastore from the list and click **Edit** to extend it.

![DatastoreExtend](/images/vCenterPlugin/DatastoreExtend.png "Extension Options")

The new size must be larger than the current size and less than the total available capacity.
For best performance, we recommend using less than 80% of the total available size.
Using decimal notation rounds down the size to the nearest 1024 bytes (or whatever the configured default block size for the volume is).
Click **Extend Datastore**.
Datastores reserve some available space for internal use and set the available capacity to slightly less than the chosen amount.

#### Cloning Datastores

Cloning an NFS or VMFS datastore duplicates that datastore.
Select a datastore from the list and click **Clone**.
Choose an ESXi host to store the new datastore and click **Next**.
Enter a name for the clone and click **Clone Datastore**.

vCenter starts the cloning process and continues the task in the background.
Click **Refresh** after some time to see the cloned datastore.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "RBAC" >}}
An administrator can grant vCenter users specific role-based access to the TrueNAS systems managed by this plugin.
New vCenter users must be created in **Menu > Administration > Single Sign On > Users and Groups** before RBAC roles can be created.

![RBACRoles](/images/vCenterPlugin/RBACRoles.png "RBAC Roles")

{{< truetable >}}
| Role Name       | User is allowed to:            |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Discovery       | Add TrueNAS systems to vCenter |
| Create Clones   | Copy existing datastores       |
| Create Storage  | Create new datastores          |
| Modify Storage  | Edit existing datastores       |
| Destroy Storage | Delete datastores              |
{{< /truetable >}}

Each role gives the user the ability to perform the functions in that role and all of the roles that precede it in the list.
For example, a user with a Create Storage role can create a new datastore and clone existing datastores.
The vCenter administrator account always has all permissions.

#### Add a Role to an Existing vCenter User

Click **+** to open the **Add Role Based Access Control** window.
Type a user name in the form `DOMAIN.NAME\username`, where `DOMAIN.NAME` is the user domain found in the **vCenter Menu > Administration > Single Sign On > Users and Groups** page.
Open the **Assign Role** dropdown list and choose a role for the user.
Click **Add** to add the role.

If the entry does not appear in the list immediately, click **Refresh**.
