The Asigra DS-System app enables you to offer a robust, scalable service to multiple customers.
Agentless architecture, where customers only need to install the DS-Client on one LAN computer, eliminates the need to install software on each target backup/restore computer.

If the DS-Client is networked with the target backup/restore computers, you can browse data, back it up, and restore it as required.
Customers can run automatic and unattended backups for data environments ranging from single-user standalone computers to enterprise-wide LANs and WANs.

During backups, the DS-Client extracts changed data, compresses it, and encrypts the items specified for backup.
Only new or modified data is backed up. This accelerates the backup transmission time.
Backed-up data is transmitted to the secure off-site data center hosting the DS-System vault over the Internet, intranet, or a direct dial-up connection.
After clearing security measures for the DS-Client, restores are performed on demand, through the same DS-Client.

The TrueNAS Asigra DS-System app is the vault. An agentless DS-Client backs up data in the vault.
The DS-Operator is the management software for the DS-System.

After installing the Asigra DS-System app, register an account with Asigra if you do not already have one.
Refer to communications from Asigra for the license and the link to the DS-Operator download.
See [Setting Up Asigra in the DS Operator](#setting-up-asigra-in-the-ds-operator) below for the next steps after installing the Asigra DS-System app.

## Understanding App Installation Wizard Settings
The following section provides more detailed explanations of the settings in each section of the **Install Asigra DS-System** installation wizard.

### Application Name Settings

{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/InstallWizardAppNameAndVersion.md" >}}

### Asigra DS-System Configuration Settings

{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/InstallWizardTimezoneSetting.md" >}}

The app includes three passwords:
* **Database Password** - Sets a password for the DS-System database.
* **Root Password** - Set a password for the root run-as user. Allowed to connect to the DS-Operator GUI but is not assigned the administration roles.
  The root user can create a new user in the DS-Operator and assign administration roles to the new user. Refer to Asigra documentation for more information on assigning administration roles.
* **Operator Password** - Sets the password for the default DS-Operator administration user account **oper**.
  This user is preassigned the administration roles. Connect to the DS-Operator with this account and password.

Select the language for the DS-Operator. This sets the on-screen language for the DS-Operator UI. The default is English.

#### Adding Environment Variables

{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/InstallWizardEnvironVariablesSettings.md" >}}

Asigra provides information on environment variables you can add through their DS-Client.
For more information on these variables, see Sections 5.18.2 and 5.21.2 in the [DS-Client User Guide](https://asigra-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/Guides/Cloud+Backup/v14.2/DS-Client_User_Guide.pdf).

### Network Configuration Settings
The TrueNAS Asigra DS-System app has three default ports:

* **4401** assigned to and exposes the DS-Client
* **4404** assigned to and exposes the DS-Operator admin interface
* **4409** assigned to and exposes the DS-System replication interface

{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/InstallWizardDefaultPorts.md" >}}
{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/InstallWizardHostNetworkSettings.md" >}}
{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/InstallWisardAdvancedDNSSettings.md" >}}

### Storage Configuration Settings
TrueNAS provides two options for storage volumes: ixVolumes and host paths.
Asigra DS-System expects two host path storage volumes, **data** to hold app DS-System data and **postgres_data** for postgres database storage.

{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/InstallAppsStorageConfig.md" >}}

If you organize the **data** and **postgres_data** datasets under a parent dataset named *asigra*, you can set the permissions for the postgres and parent datasets by selecting **Automatic Permissions** under the **Asigra DS-System Postgres Data Configuration** settings.
To show this option, set **Type** to **Host Path**. See **Setting Dataset ACL Permissions** below.

You can add extra storage volumes during the app installation or edit the application after it deploys. Stop the app before editing settings.
{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/InstallAppStorageConfig2.md" >}}

#### Setting Dataset ACL Permissions
You can configure ACL permissions for a dataset through the **Install Asigra DS-System** wizard or from the **Datasets** screen after adding the datasets.
We recommend using the **Automatic Permissions** option found in the **Asigra DS-System Postgres Data Storage** section to set the permissions for the postgres and parent datasets.
Setting permissions from the **Datasets** screen requires several adjustments that, if not correctly set, prevent the app from deploying.

{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/InstallWizardStorageACLConfig.md" >}}

{{< expand "Adding ACL Permissions from the Datasets Screen" "v" >}}
First, select the dataset row, scroll down to the **Permissions** widget, and click **Edit** to open the **Edit ACL** screen.
Change the **@owner** and **@group** values from **root** to the administrative user for your TrueNAS system, and click apply for each.
Next, add an ACL entry for the run-as user **0** for **root**. You can also add the app default user **568** for **apps**.
Save the ACL before leaving the screen.
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Adding Postgres and Parent Dataset ACL Permissions" "v" >}}
First, set **Type** to **Host Path** to show the **Automatic Permissions** option.
Do not select **Enable ACL** as this removes the **Automatic Permissions** option.

Next, enter or browse to select **postgres_data** and populate the **Host Path** field with the path to this dataset.
Select **Automatic Permissions**. TrueNAS sets the required permissions for the postgres storage volume dataset and the parent dataset.
{{< /expand>}}

TrueNAS **Additional Storage** options include the ability to mount an SMB share inside the container pod.
{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/InstallWizardStorageConfig2.md" >}}

#### Mounting an SMB Share Storage Volume
If adding an SMB share as an additional storage volume, create the SMB dataset and share user(s), and add the user ID for the share user(s) to the dataset ACL.
