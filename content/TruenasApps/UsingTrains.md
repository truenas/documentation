TrueNAS has a pre-built official catalog of available iXsystems-approved applications.

Users can configure and add catalog trains if they choose.
The default train is **stable** which shows the apps found in the charts repository. Other available trains are **enterprise** and **community**.

{{< hint type=note >}}
TrueNAS uses outbound ports 80/443 to retrieve the TRUENAS catalog.

## Managing the Application Catalog
Users can manage the catalog by changing the trains included in it.
To add or remove a train, from the **Installed** application screen, click **Configuration** then on **Settings** on the dropdown menu to open the **Settings** screen.
You can also click **Manage Installed Apps** at the top right of the **Discover** screen to open the **Installed** screen.

Users can change the catalog trains and show apps in those trains on the **Settings** screen.
After making a change, go to the **Discover** screen and click on **Refresh Catalog** to pull the catalog from the repository and refresh it in TrueNAS.

To remove a train from the catalog, select the checkbox for the train on the **Settings** screen to clear the checkbox, then click **Save**.
You must have one train selected.
