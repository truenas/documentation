[Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) is a web bookmarking application supporting tags, search, multi-users, page snapshots, and more.

## Before you begin

Before you install Linkding:
- Check out the [installation instructions](https://linkding.link/installation/) to learn more about installaing and administrating Linkding.
- Determine whether you want to use the page snapshot feature, available in the Linkding `latest-plus` image.
  If using snapshots, you might want to consider assigning a host path for **Linkding Data Storage** if you're expecting to have a large collection of page snapshots.
- Figure out where you want to keep passwords for the Linkding database and Linkding users.

## Install Linkding

If installing Linkding with everything with both Linkding Data Storage and Linkding Postgres Data Storage set to **ixVolume**, installation should be fairly straightforward.

{{< hint type=note >}}
TrueNAS does not recommend ixVolume datasets as permanent storage volumes for production deployments.
See [Understanding App Storage Volumes]({{< relref "truenasapps/_index.md#understanding-app-storage-volumes" >}}) for more information.
{{< /hint >}} 

If setting a custom host path for Linkding Data Storage (e.g. for storing page snapshots to a zfs pool), you'll likely want to select **Enable ACL** and then within **ACL Entries** set ID type (e.g. for user), ID (e.g. 568, or whatever is set as the User and Group for Linkding on the same settings page) and Access (FULL_CONTROL) appropriately.
Failure to set up ACL appropriately when using a custom host path causes Linkding to not run (i.e. return an Internal Server Error).

You might also need to set up a way to securely host the service, using guides such as [HOWTO: Host a Service privately on TrueNAS with a valid SSL Certificate](https://forums.truenas.com/t/howto-host-a-service-privately-on-truenas-with-a-valid-ssl-certificate/15243).
