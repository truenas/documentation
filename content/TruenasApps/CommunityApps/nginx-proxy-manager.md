[Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com) <!-- is a [description of the application] -->

## Installation

There is a notice when you install the app that it needs to run as the `root` user.
What this means practically is that when you are installing the app you will need to set the `User ID` to `0` (instead of `568` or whatever it is on your system).

Nginx Proxy Manager takes a few minutes to install.
When it's running, click on `Nginx Proxy Manager` to go to the details page, then click on the `web portal` button to go to the Nginx Proxy Manager app itself.

The log in credentials on a fresh install are:
* user: admin@example.com
* pass: changeme
