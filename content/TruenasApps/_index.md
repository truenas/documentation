TrueNAS applications allow for quick and easy integration of third-party software and TrueNAS.
The TrueNAS applications backend changed in 24.10 to Docker images managed with Docker Compose.
Earlier TrueNAS releases operated with Kubernetes K3 and Helm providing containers for applications.
For more information on this change refer to the [24.10 Release Note]({{< relref "/Content/SCALE/GettingStarted/ScaleReleaseNotes.md" >}}).

{{< include file="/static/includes/ProposeArticleChange.md" >}}

TrueNAS is certified with leading hypervisors and backup solutions to streamline storage operations and ensure compatibility with your existing IT infrastructure.
TrueNAS delivers a wide range of features and scalability for virtualization and private cloud environments, with the ability to create off-site backups with scheduled sync and replication features.
TrueNAS applications expand the capabilities of your system by adding third-party software, but they can add significant risk to system stability and security.

## Getting Started
All applications added to TrueNAS are intended to expand system functionality far beyond what is typically expected from a NAS.

Applications are provided "as-is" and can introduce system stability or security issues when installed.
Make sure the application is required for your specific use requirements and does not violate your security policies before installation.

You must choose a pool before you can install an application.

## Managing Apps Configuration
Use the **Configuration** dropdown to access the **Choose Pool**, **Unset Pool**, **Manage Container Images**, and **Settings** options.

### Choosing the Application Pool
You are prompted to [select the pool for apps](#choosing-the-apps-pool) the first time you click on **Apps**.
You can exit out of this if you are not ready to deploy apps or do not have a pool configured for apps to use for storage.
You must set the pool before you can add any application.

We recommend keeping the application use case in mind when choosing a pool.
Select a pool with enough space for all the applications you intend to use.
For stability, we also recommend using SSD storage for the applications pool.

Select the pool and click **Save**. If you close the dialog to set the pool later, click **Configuration > Choose Pool** to set the pool.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsSettingsChoosePool.png" alt="Choosing a Pool for Apps" id="Choosing a Pool for Apps" >}}

If you want to set up new datasets to store your application data in a location separate from other storage on your system, create the datasets before installing the application.
For example, create the datasets for the Nextcloud app before installing the app.

{{< include file="/static/includes/AppsVMsNoHTTPS.md" >}}

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/SystemSettingsGUISettingsSCALE.png" alt="General System Settings" id="General System Settings" >}}

### Unsetting the Apps Pool
To select a different pool for apps to use, click **Configuration > Unset Pool**. This turns off the apps service until you choose another pool for apps to use.

### Configuring Apps Settings

Click **Configuration > Settings** to open the **Settings** screen, which contains options for setting apps trains, configuring app networking, installing NVIDIA drivers (if compatible hardware is present), and allowing TrueNAS to monitor for Docker image updates.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsSettingScreen.png" alt="Apps Settings Screen" id="Apps Settings Screen" >}}

#### Changing App Trains
TrueNAS applications are available in three catalogs (trains):

* **stable** - Default train of official apps, vetted by iXsystems, chosen because of the features and functionality of the app, and how they integrate with TrueNAS.
* **enterprise** - Default train of apps, simplified and validated for Enterprise users for Enterprise-licensed systems.
* **community** - Apps proposed and maintained by the community

The default TrueNAS **Stable** catalog populates the **Discover** apps screen with apps.

Some apps proposed by community members might be adopted as official **stable** train apps.
iXsystems maintains official apps for non-Enterprise and community users.

Click **Settings** on the **Configuration** dropdown menu to open the **Settings** screen, then select the desired train(s).
To show only the one train of apps, for example, the **enterprise** train, after selecting **enterprise** deselect the **stable** checkbox and click **Save**.

For more information on trains, see [Managing App Trains]({{< relref "UsingTrains.md" >}}).

Some applications deploy as the **root** user for initial configuration before operating as a non-root user.
Keep these general best practices in mind when using applications with TrueNAS.

#### Changing Apps Network Settings
Go to **Apps > Installed**, click **Configuration** and then on **Settings**.

To add an additional range of IP addresses, click **Add** to the right of **Address Pools**, then select a range from the dropdown list of options, and enter the desired value in **Size**.

**Base** shows the default IP address and subnet, and **Size** shows the network size of each docker network that is cut off from the base subnet.

{{< hint type="info" title="Apps Networking Troubleshooting Tip!" >}}
This setting replaces the Kubernetes Settings option for Bind Network in 24.04 and earlier.
Use to resolve issues where apps experiences issues where TrueNAS device is not reachable from some networks.
Select the network option, or add additional options to resolve the network connection issues.
{{< /hint >}}

#### Installing NVIDIA Drivers
Beginning in TrueNAS 24.10, NVIDIA drivers are no longer automatically installed. Users must manually install drivers from the TrueNAS UI.

If running TrueNAS 24.10 or higher:
1. Go to **Apps > Installed** and click on the **Configuration**.

2. Click on **Settings** to open the **Settings** configuration screen.

3. Select **Install NVIDIA Drivers**, which is available to users with compatible GPUs.

4. Select **Install NVIDIA Drivers**, and click **Save.**

#### Monitoring for Image Updates
Select **Check for docker image updates** (selected by default) to enable TrueNAS to periodically check for Docker image updates.
This applies to all Docker images present on the system for either catalog or custom applications.
Disable to prevent TrueNAS from monitoring for upstream image updates.

### Managing Container Images
While on the **Installed** application screen, click **Configuration** > **Manage Container Images** to open the **Manage Container Images** screen.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsManageContainerImages.png" alt="Apps Manage Container Images" id="Apps Manage Container Images" >}}

Delete images or add new ones from this screen.

**Pull Image** downloads a specific custom image to TrueNAS.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsManageContainerImagesPullImage.png" alt="Pull a Container Image" id="Pull a Container Image" >}}

To download a specific image, click **Pull Image**, then enter a valid path and tag to the image.
Enter the path using the format *registry*/*repository*/*image* to identify the specific image.
The default **latest** tag downloads the most recent image version.

When downloading a private image, enter user account credentials that allow access to the private registry.

## Installing an Application
The first time you go to **Apps**, a dialog prompts your to choose the pool apps use. You must set the app pool before you can install applications.
Select the pool as described in the [**Choosing the Application Pool**](#choosing-the-application-pool).

The **Installed** applications screen displays **Check Available Apps** before you install the first application.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsInstalledAppsScreenNoApps.png" alt="Installed Applications Screen No Apps" id="Installed Applications Screen No Apps" >}}

Click either **Check Available Apps** or **Discover Apps** to open the **[Discover](#using-the-discover-applications-screen)** screen.

Search for the application widget, then click on that widget to open the information screen for the app and to access the installation wizard.

{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/AppsSMBErrorWarning.md" >}}

If an application requires specific datasets, configure them before launching the installation wizard.

### Using an App Installation Wizard
After clicking on an app widget on the **Discover Apps** screen, the information screen for that app opens.
Click **Install** to open the installation wizard for the application.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/MinIOS3AppInfoScreen.png" alt="Application Information Screen Example" id="Application Information Screen Example" >}}

The installation wizard configuration sections vary by application, with some including more configuration areas than others.
Each application tutorial provides information on steps to take before launching an app installation wizard, but if a tutorial does not exist, click **Install** on the app information screen to open the wizard.
Review settings ahead of time to check for required settings and then exit the wizard to do the necessary steps before returning to install the application.
Click **Discover** on the breadcrumb at the top of the app wizard screen to exiting the without saving.

{{< hint type="info" title="Community Maintained Apps" >}}
Apps submitted and maintained by community members using the **Custom App** option might not include an installation wizard.
Refer to tutorials created and maintained by the community for more information on deploying and using these applications.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/AppsInstallWizardSettings.md" >}}

After clicking **Install** on an application wizard screen, the **Installed** applications screen opens showing the application in the **Deploying** state before
changing to **Running**. 
Applications that crash show the **Crashed** status. Click **Stop** changes the status to **Stopping** before going to **Stopped**.
Click **Start** to restart the application.

The screen defaults to selecting the first app row listed on the **Applications** table and showing the application widgets that first app.
To modify installed application settings, first click on the app row on the **Applications** table, then click **Edit** on the **Application Info** widget.

Refer to individual tutorials in the [Stable]({{< relref "/content/TruenasApps/StableApps/_index.md" >}}), [Community]({{< relref "/content/TruenasApps/CommunityApps/_index.md" >}}), or [Enterprise]({{< relref "/content/TruenasApps/EnterpriseApps/_index.md" >}}) sections of the Documentation Hub for more details on configuring application settings.

#### Allocating GPU
Users with compatible hardware can allocate one or more GPU devices to an application for use in hardware acceleration.
Allocating GPUs is an advanced process that could require significant troubleshooting depending on the installed GPU device(s) and application-specific criteria.

GPU devices can be available for the host operating system (OS) and applications or can be [isolated for use in a Virtual Machine (VM)]({{< relref "managegpuscale.md" >}}).
A single GPU cannot be shared between the OS/applications and a VM.

Allocate the GPU from the **Resources Configuration** section of the application installation wizard screen or the **Edit** screen for a deployed application.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/ResourcesConfiguration.png" alt="Resources Configuration" id="Resources Configuration" >}}

Click the **GPU Resource** allocation row for the type of GPU (AMD, Intel, or NVIDIA) and select the number of GPU devices the application is allowed access to.
You cannot specify which available GPU device TrueNAS allocates to the application. Furthermore, assigned devices can change on reboot.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/ResourcesConfigurationAllocateGPU.png" alt="Select GPU Allocation" id="Select GPU Allocation" >}}

{{< expand "Troubleshooting GPU Allocation" "v" >}}
If installed GPU devices do not populate as available for allocation in **GPU Configuration**:

1. Ensure the GPU devices you want to allocate are not configured as isolated.
   Go to **System > Advanced Settings** and locate the **Isolated GPU Device(s)** widget.
   If necessary, click **Configure**, deselect the device(s) you want to allocate, and click **Save**.

2. Ensure the GPU devices you want to allocate are not assigned to any existing VMs.
   Go to **Virtualization**.
   Select an existing VM and click on that row to expand it, then click **Edit**.
   Scroll down to **GPU** and review configured devices.
   If necessary, deselect the device you want to allocate to applications.
   Repeat for any additional VMs on the system.

If the GPU was previously isolated and/or assigned to a VM, you might need to reboot to free it up for app allocation.
Restart the system then return to the **Resources Configuration** section of the application to see if expected devices are available.

### Installing Custom Applications
{{< include file="/static/includes/apps/CustomAppIntro.md" >}}

See [Installing Custom Applications]({{< relref "UsingCustomApp.md" >}}) for more information.

## Upgrading Apps
Apps with available upgrades show a yellow circle with an exclamation point on the right side of the **Applications** table row, and the **Installed** application screen banner displays an **Update** or an **Update All** button.
To upgrade an app, select the app row and click **Update** on the **Application Info** widget.
To upgrade multiple apps, either click the **Update All** button on the **Installed** applications banner, or select the checkbox to the left of the application row to show the **Bulk Actions** button.
Click **Bulk Actions** and select **Upgrade All** to upgrade the apps selected.
Upgrade options only show if TrueNAS detects an available update for installed applications.

**Update** opens an upgrade window that includes two selectable options, **Images (to be updated)** and **Changelog**.
Click on the down arrow to see the options available for each.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppUpdateWindow.png" alt="Update Application Window" id="Update Application Window" >}}

Click **Upgrade** to begin the process. A counter dialog opens showing the upgrade progress.
When complete, the update badge and buttons disappear and the application **Update** state on the **Installed** screen changes from **Update Available** to **Up to date**.

## Deleting Apps
To delete an application, click <i class="fa fa-stop" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Stop** on the application row.
After the app status changes to stopped, click **Delete** on the **Application Info** widget for the selected application to open the **Delete** dialog.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsDeleteAppDialog.png" alt="Delete Application Dialog" id="Delete Application Dialog" >}}

Select **Remove ixVolumes** to delete hidden app storage from the Apps pool.

Click **Confirm** then **Continue** to delete the application.

## Discover Screen Options
The **Discover** screen shows application widgets based on the trains selected on the **Train Settings** screen.

Non-Enterprise systems show the **stable** catalog of apps by default.
These are official applications, pre-configured to only require a name during a test deployment, or some customization for a full deployment.

Enterprise-licensed systems display the **enterprise** train of applications simplified and validated for Enterprise systems.

Community users can add the **community** and **enterprise** trains on the [**Settings**](#changing-app-trains) screen.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsDiscoverScreen.png" alt="Applications Discover Screen" id="Applications Discover Screen" >}}

Use the **Discover** screen links to access other functions.

* [**Refresh Catalog**](#refreshing-the-apps-catalog) - Refreshes the list of app widgets after changing train settings or changes to the catalog.
* **Manage Installed Apps** - Opens the **Installed** apps screen where you access the **Configuration** menu to manage general application settings.

### Refreshing the Apps Catalog
Click **Refresh Catalog** on the **Discover** screen to refresh the apps catalog.
Refresh the apps catalog after adding or editing the app trains on your system.

### Using the Discover Screen Filters
To change how app widgets show on the screen, click the down arrow to the right of **Filters**, and select the filter option to use.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/DiscoverAppsScreenFilterOptions.png" alt="Discover Apps Filter Options" id="Discover Apps Filter Options" >}}

To quickly locate a specific app, begin typing the name in the search field. The screen shows apps matching the typed entry.

To sort app widgets by category, click on **Categories**.
To select multiple categories, click **Categories** again and select another category from the dropdown.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/MinIOS3AppInfoScreen.png" alt="Application Information Screen Example" id="Application Information Screen Example" >}}

After installing an application, the **Installed** applications screen shows the app in the **Deploying** state.
The status changes to **Running** when the application is fully deployed and ready to use.
