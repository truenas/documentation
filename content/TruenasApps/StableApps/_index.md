The **stable** train populates the application catalog with the official applications.
The **Discover** screen shows the **stable** train applications by default.

Applications in the **stable** catalog are added and maintained by iXsystems and are intended to expand system functionality far beyond what is typically expected from a NAS.
Some apps replace deprecated services or functionality previously built into TrueNAS.

The tutorials in this section are for the commonly-used **stable** train catalog.

For information on adding to or changing the train for the apps catalog, see [Managing App Trains]({{< relref "UsingTrains.md" >}}).
