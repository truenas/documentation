Prometheus is a monitoring platform that collects metrics from *targets* it monitors. Targets are system HTTP endpoints configured in the Prometheus web UI. Prometheus is itself an HTTP endpoint so it can monitor itself.

Prometheus collects and stores metrics such as time series data. Information stored is time-stamped at the point when it is recorded.
Prometheus uses key-value pairs called *labels* to differentiate characteristics of what is measured.

Use the Prometheus application to record numeric time series.
Also use it to diagnose problems with the monitored endpoints when there is a system outage.

TrueNAS makes installing Prometheus easy, but you must use the Prometheus web portal to configure targets, labels, alerts, and queries.

{{< include file="/static/includes/AppsUnversioned.md" >}}

## Before You Begin
The TrueNAS Prometheus app installs, completes the initial configuration, then starts the Prometheus Rule Manager.
When updates become available, TrueNAS alerts and provides easy updates.

Before installing the TrueNAS Prometheus app, review the [Prometheus Configuration documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/) and list of feature flags and environment variables to see if you want to include any during installation.
You can configure environment variables at any time after deploying the application.

TrueNAS does not need advance preparation.

If not using the default user and group to manage the application, create a new user (and group) and take note of the IDs.

You can allow TrueNAS to create the two datasets Prometheus requires automatically during app installation.
Or before beginning app installation, [create the datasets]({{< relref "DatasetsSCALE.md" >}}) named **data** and **config** to use in the **Storage Configuration** section during installation.

## Installing the Prometheus Application
To install the **Prometheus** application, go to **Apps**, click **Discover Apps**, either begin typing Prometheus into the search field or scroll down to locate the **Prometheus** application widget.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/PrometheusWidget.png" alt="Prometheus App Widget" id="Prometheus App Widget" >}}

Click on the widget to open the **Prometheus** application details screen.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/PrometheusAppDetailsScreen.png" alt="Prometheus App Details Screen" id="Prometheus App Details Screen" >}}

Click **Install** to open the Prometheus application configuration screen.

Application configuration settings are presented in several sections, each explained below.
To find specific fields click in the **Search Input Fields** search field, scroll down to a particular section or click on the section heading on the navigation area in the upper-right corner.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/InstallPrometheusScreen.png" alt="Install Prometheus Screen" id="Install Prometheus Screen" >}}

Accept the default values in **Application Name** and **Version**.

Accept the default value in **Retention Time** or change to suit your needs.
Enter values in days (d), weeks (w), months (m), or years (y). For example, 15d, 2w, 3m, 1y.

Enter the amount of storage space to allocate for the application in **Retention Size**.
Valid entries include integer and suffix, for example: 100MB, 10GB, etc.

You can add arguments or environment variables to customize your installation but these are not required.
To show the **Argument** entry field or the environment variable **Name** and **Value** fields, click **Add** for whichever type you want to add.
Click again to add another argument or environment variable.

Accept the default port in **API Port**.
Select **Host Network** to bind to the host network, but we recommend leaving this disabled.

Prometheus requires two storage datasets.
You can allow TrueNAS to create these for you, or use the datasets named **data** and **config** created before in [First Steps](#first-steps).
Select the storage option you want to use for both **Prometheus Data Storage** and **Prometheus Config Storage**.
Select **ixVolume** in **Type** to let TrueNAS create the dataset or select **Host Path** to use the existing datasets created on the system.

Accept the defaults in Resources or change the CPU and memory limits to suit your use case.

Click **Install**.
The system opens the **Installed Applications** screen with the Prometheus app in the **Deploying** state.
When the installation completes it changes to **Running**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/PrometheusInstalled.png" alt="Prometheus Installed" id="Prometheus Installed" >}}

Click **Web Portal** on the **Application Info** widget to open the Prometheus web interface to begin configuring targets, alerts, rules and other parameters.

## Understanding TrueNAS Prometheus Wizard Settings
The following sections provide more detailed explanations of the settings found in each section of the **Install Prometheus** screen.

### Application Name Settings

{{< include file="/static/includes/InstallWizardAppNameAndVersion.md" >}}

### Prometheus Configuration Settings
You can accept the defaults in the **Prometheus Configuration** settings, or enter the settings you want to use.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/InstallPrometheusConfigSettings.png" alt="Prometheus Configuration Settings" id="Prometheus Configuration Settings" >}}

Accept the default in **Retention Time** or change to any value that suits your needs.
Enter values in days (d), weeks (w), months (m), or years (y). For example, 15d, 2w, 3m, 1y.

**Retention Size** is not required to install the application. To limit the space allocated to retain data, add a value such as 100MB, 10GB, etc.

Select **WAL Compression** to enable compressing the write-ahead log.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/InstallPrometheusConfigAddArgEnvVar.png" alt="Add Argument or Environment Variable" id="Add Argument or Environment Variable" >}}

Add Prometheus environment variables in TrueNAS using the **Additional Environment Variables** option.
Click **Add** for each variable you want to add.
Enter the Prometheus flag in **Name** and desired value in **Value**. For a complete list see Prometheus documentation on [Feature Flags](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/).

### Networking Settings

Accept the default port numbers in **API Port**.
The TrueNAS Prometheus app listens on port **30002**.

Refer to the TrueNAS [default port list](https://www.truenas.com/docs/references/defaultports/) for a list of assigned port numbers.
To change the port numbers, enter a number within the range 9000-65535.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/InstallPrometheusNetworkConfig.png" alt="Prometheus Networking" id="Prometheus Networking" >}}

We recommend not selecting **Host Network**. This binds to the host network.

### Storage Settings
You can install Prometheus using the default setting **ixVolume (dataset created automatically by the system)** or use the host path option with the two datasets created before installing the app.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/InstallPrometheusStorageConfigixVolume.png" alt="Prometheus Configure Storage ixVolumes" id="Prometheus Configure Storage ixVolumes" >}}

Select **Host Path (Path that already exists on the system)** to browse to and select the **data** and **config** datasets.
Set **Prometheus Data Storage** to the **data** dataset path, and **Prometheus Config Storage** to the **config** dataset path.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/InstallPrometheusStorageConfigHostPath.png" alt="Prometheus Host Paths" id="Prometheus Host Paths" >}}

### Resource Configuration Settings
Accept the default values in **Resources Configuration** or enter new CPU and memory values
By default, this application is limited to use no more than 4 CPU cores and 8 Gigabytes available memory. The application might use considerably less system resources.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Apps/InstallPrometheusResourceConfig.png" alt="Prometheus Resource Limits" id="Prometheus Resource Limits" >}}

To customize the CPU and memory allocated to the container (pod) Prometheus uses, enter new CPU values as a plain integer value followed by the suffix m (milli).
Default is 4000m.

Accept the default value 8Gi allocated memory or enter a new limit in bytes.
Enter a plain integer followed by the measurement suffix, for example 129M or 123Mi.
