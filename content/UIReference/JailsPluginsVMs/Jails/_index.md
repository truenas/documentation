| **EDIT** | Used to modify the settings described in Advanced Jail Creation. You cannot edit a jail while it is running. You can only view the settings that are read only until you stop the jail operation. |
| **MOUNT POINTS** | Select an existing mount point to edit. Either click **EDIT** or click **ACTIONS** > **Add Mount Point** to create a mount point for the jail. A mount point gives a jail access to storage located elsewhere on the system. You must stop a jail before adding, editing, or deleting a mount point. See Additional Storage for more details. |
| **RESTART** | Stops and immediately starts a jail that is running or **up**. |
| **START** | Starts a jail that has a current **STATE** of **down**. |
| **STOP** | Stops a jail that has a current **STATE** of **up**. |
| **UPDATE** | Runs [freebsd-update](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update) to update the jail to the latest patch level of the installed FreeBSD release. |
| **SHELL** | Displays the **Shell** screen which provides access a *root* command prompt to interact with a jail directly from the command line. Type `exit` to leave the command prompt and display the **Jails** screen. |
| **DELETE** | Deletes the selected jail. Caution: deleting the jail also deletes all of the jail contents and all associated snapshots. Back up the jail data, configuration, and programs first. There is no way to recover the contents of a jail after deleting it! |
