If you want to access your TrueNAS directories from within a virtual machine or container hosted on the system, you have multiple options:

* Allow TrueNAS to create an automatic bridge (default)
* If you have only one physical interface, you can manually create a bridge interface.
* If your system has more than one physical interface, you can assign a NIC other than the primary one your TrueNAS server uses.
  This method makes communication more flexible but does not offer the potential speed benefits of a bridge.
  Instances (Linux containers or VMs) allow you to configure a MACVLAN NIC.
  A MACVLAN NIC creates a virtual network interface based on an existing physical interface, assigning it a unique MAC address to allow the instance to appear as a separate device on the network.

## Using Default Network Settings

Leave **Use default network settings** selected while creating a new instance to allow TrueNAS to automatically assign the default network bridge.
This is the simplest way to allow communication between containers and the TrueNAS host.

## Creating a Bridge: Single Physical Interface

If your system only has a single physical interface, and you prefer to manually configure a network bridge, complete these steps.

{{< include file="/static/includes/BeforeYouBridge.md" >}}

{{< include file="/static/includes/NetworkBridgeSCALE.md" >}}

12. To assign the bridge to a VM or container, go to **Instances**, select the instance you want to use to access TrueNAS storage, and locate the **NIC** widget.
   Click **Add** and select the new bridge interface from the dropdown list.

You can now access your TrueNAS storage from the container.
You might have to set up [shares]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Shares/_index.md" >}}) or [users]({{< relref "ManageLocalUsersSCALE.md" >}}) with home directories to access certain files.

## Assigning a Secondary NIC: Multiple Physical Interfaces

If you have more than one NIC on your system, you can assign container traffic to a secondary NIC.
Configure the secondary interface as described in [Managing Interfaces]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Network/Interfaces/_index.md" >}}) before attaching it to an instance.

If you are creating a new instance, use the **Network** settings to deselect **Use default network Settings** and select the secondary NIC from **Macvlan NICs**.

To edit the NIC attached to an existing VM:

1. Go to **Instances**, select the instance you want to use to access TrueNAS storage, and locate the **NIC** widget.

2. Click **Add** and select the secondary interface from the **MAC VLAN** dropdown list.

## VM Access Examples

{{< expand "Linux Example" "v" >}}
Linux VMs and containers can access TrueNAS storage using FTP, SMB, and NFS.

In the example below, the Linux VM uses FTP to access a home directory for a user on TrueNAS.

{{< expand "Windows Example" "v" >}}
Windows VMs can access TrueNAS storage using FTP and SMB.

The example below shows the Windows VM accessing an SMB share on TrueNAS.
