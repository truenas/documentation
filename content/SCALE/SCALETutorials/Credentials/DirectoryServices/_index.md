The TrueNAS Directory Services tutorials contain options to edit directory domain and account settings, set up ID mapping, and configure authentication and authorization services in TrueNAS.

## Choosing Active Directory or LDAP

When setting up directory services in TrueNAS, you can connect TrueNAS to either an Active Directory or an LDAP server but not both.

To view Idmap and Kerberos Services, click **Show** next to **Advanced Settings**.
