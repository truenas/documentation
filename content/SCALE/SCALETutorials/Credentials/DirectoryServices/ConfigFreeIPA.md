TrueNAS provides the option to configure a FreeIPA directory service client using the **LDAP** configuration screen under **Credentials > Directory Services**.

{{< expand "Does LDAP work with SMB?" "v" >}}
LDAP authentication for SMB shares is disabled unless you configured and populated the LDAP directory with Samba attributes.
The most popular script for performing this task is `smbldap-tools`.
TrueNAS needs to be able to validate the full certificate chain (no self-signed certificates).
TrueNAS does not support non-CA certificates.

You can have either Active Directory or LDAP configured on TrueNAS, but not both.

## Before You Begin
You must do the following things listed in this section. See the procedure below for detailed steps.

Your IPA server must have DNS properly configured and have access through the firewall. Having functional DNS for the IPA domain is an absolute requirement.
If improperly configured, the IPA server cannot resolve Kerberos SRV records and the configuration in TrueNAS fails with network errors.
Running the IPA server as the LDAP client automatically joins the realm with the ldap creds.

Change the global network settings default **Hostname** setting from **truenas** to any other name. Leaving it set to the default breaks the configuration.

Change **Nameserver 1** to the IP address for the IPA server and remove any other IP addresses configured as **Nameserver 2** and **Nameserver 3**.
Having extra non-IPA DNS nameserver addresses configured in TrueNAS breaks DNS.

You must set the **LDAP** screen **Hostname** to the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for for the IPA server.
Setting it to the IPA server IP address breaks the configuration.

Check the **LDAP** screen **Base DN** setting for extraneous spaces between dn records and remove them.

The LDAP service goes into a degraded state for systems with misconfigured FreeIPA.

To use Kerberos for NFS/SMB authentication, do not point a random windows client at the server or SMB does not work.

## Configuring LDAP

To configure TrueNAS for a FreeIPA server:

1. Go to **Network** and click **Configure** on the **Global Network Settings** widget to open the network settings screen.
   
   a. Change the **Hostname** to something other than the default **truenas** value. This can be any name of your choosing.

   b. Change the IP address in **Nameserver 1** to the IP address assigned to the IPA server.

   c. Delete any other IP addresses in both **Nameserver 2** and **Nameserver 3**.

   d. Click **Save**

2. Go to **Credentials > Directory Services** and click **Configure LDAP**.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Credentials/LDAPBasicOptionsSettings.png" alt="LDAP Basic Options" id="LDAP Basic Options" >}}

   a. Enter the FQDN for the IPA server in the **Hostname** field. Do not enter the IP address for the IPA server!

   b. Enter the base DN for the IPA server. For example, if the FQDN name is *myIPAserver.mydept.mycompany.net*, enter dc=*mycompany*,dc=*mydept*,dc=*net* if this represents the top of the top level of the LDAP directory tree to use when searching for resources.
      Make sure there are no spaces between entries, and separate each dn entry with a comma.

   c. Enter the bind DN. Include the uid=*admin*,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=*mydept*,dc=*mycompany*,dc=*net* in the entry.
   
   d. Enter the bind password, which is the password for the administrator account.

5. Select **Enable** to activate the server.

6. Click **Save**.

TrueNAS creates the Kerberos key and realm, and populates these fields on the **LDAP Advanced Options** screen.
See the [LDAP UI Reference article]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/LDAP.md" >}}) for details about advanced settings.

## Disabling LDAP

To disable IPA server but not remove the configuration, clear the **Enable** checkbox.
The main **Directory Services** screen returns to the default view showing the options to configure Active Directory or LDAP.
To enable again, click **Configure LDAP** to open the **LDAP** screen with your saved configuration.
Select **Enable** again to reactivate your IPA directory server configuration.

## Removing LDAP from TrueNAS

To remove the LDAP configuration, click **Settings** to open the **LDAP** screen.
Clear all settings and click **Save**.
