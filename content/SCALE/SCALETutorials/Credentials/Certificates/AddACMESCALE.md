Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) DNS authenticators allow users to automate certificate issuing and renewal. The user must verify ownership of the domain before TrueNAS allows certificate automation.

{{< hint type=important >}}
ACME DNS is an advanced feature intended for network administrators or AWS professionals. Misconfiguring ACME DNS can prevent you from accessing TrueNAS.

The system requires an ACME DNS Authenticator and CSR to configure ACME certificate automation.

## Adding a DNS Authenticator

To add an authenticator,

Click **Add** on the **ACME DNS-Authenticator** widget to open the **Add DNS Authenticator** screen.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Credentials/AddDNSAuthenticatorCloudflare.png" alt="Add DNS Authenticator" id="Add DNS Authenticator" >}}

Enter a name, and select the authenticator you want to configure.
Options are **[cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)**, Amazon **[route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)**, [**OVH**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/domains/), and **shell**.
**Authenticator** selection changes the configuration fields.

If you select **cloudflare** as the authenticator, you must enter your Cloudflare account email address, API key, and API token.

If you select **route53** as the authenticator, you must enter your Route53 Access key ID and secret access key.

If you select **OVH** as the authenticator, you must enter your OVH application key, application secret, consumer key, and endpoint.  

Click **Save** to add the authenticator.

### Adding an Authenticator with a Shell Script

{{< hint type=warning >}}
The **shell** authenticator option is meant for advanced users. Improperly configured scripts can result in system instability or unexpected behavior.
{{< /hint >}}

If you select **shell** as the authenticator, you must enter the path to an authenticator script, the running user, a certificate timeout, and a domain propagation delay.

Advanced users can select this option to pass an authenticator script, such as *acme.sh*, to shell and add an external DNS authenticator.
Requires an ACME authenticator script saved to the system.
