The **Cloud Credentials** screen, accessed from the **Backup Credentials** screen allows users to integrate TrueNAS with cloud storage providers.

{{< include file="/static/includes/CloudServiceProvidersSCALE.md" >}}

To maximize security, TrueNAS encrypts cloud credentials when saving them.
However, this means that to restore any cloud credentials from a TrueNAS configuration file, you must enable **Export Password Secret Seed** when generating that [configuration backup]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/SystemSettings/General/ManageSysConfigSCALE.md" >}}).
Remember to protect any downloaded TrueNAS configuration files.

Authentication methods for each provider could differ based on the provider security requirements.
You can add credentials for many of the supported cloud storage providers from the information on the [Cloud Credentials Screens]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/BackupCredentials/CloudCredentialScreens.md" >}}).
This article provides instructions for the more involved providers.

## Adding a Cloud Credential
We recommend users open another browser tab to open and log into the cloud storage provider account you intend to link with TrueNAS.

Some TrueNAS providers credentials require entering additional information generated while creating the provider account.
For example, the Storj iX account produces an access and secret key that must be entered in the **Cloud Credential** screen to create the credential.

Have the authentication information required by your cloud storage provider on hand to make the process easier.
Authentication information can include but is not limited to user credentials, access tokens, and access and security keys.

To add a cloud credential:

1. Select the cloud service from the **Provider** dropdown list. The provider required authentication option settings display.

   For details on each provider authentication settings see [Cloud Credentials Screens]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/BackupCredentials/CloudCredentialScreens.md" >}}).

2. Enter a name for the credential.

3. Enter the required authentication credentials, such as access token, access key and/or secret keys, and user credentials for the account into the appropriate fields.

4. Click **Verify Credentials** to test the entered credentials and verify they work.

5. Click **Save**.

## Adding Storj Cloud Credentials
Storj iX is the default cloud storage provider in TrueNAS.

### Setting Up S3 Access

{{< include file="/static/includes/SetUpStorjiXAccountS3Access.md" >}}

### Creating a TrueNAS Storj Bucket

You can either create a TrueNAS compatible Storj bucket while configuring cloud credentials or wait to do so while configuring a [TrueCloud back up]({{< relref "TrueCloudTasks.md" >}}) or [Cloud Sync]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/DataProtection/CloudSyncTasks/_index.md" >}}) task.

## Adding Amazon S3 Cloud Credentials
When adding an Amazon S3 cloud credential, you can either use the default authentication settings or advanced settings if you want to include endpoint settings.

To add a cloud credential for Amazon S3, select **Amazon S3** in **Provider**, enter a name and then:

1. Open a web browser tab to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

2. Navigate to **My account > Security Credentials > Access Keys** to obtain the Amazon S3 secret access key ID.
   Access keys are alphanumeric and between 5 and 20 characters.

   If you cannot find or remember the secret access key, go to **My Account > Security Credentials > Access Keys** and create a new key pair.

3. Enter or copy/paste the access key into **Access Key ID**.

4. Enter or copy/paste the Amazon Web Services alphanumeric password that is between 8 and 40 characters into **Secret Access Key**

5. (Optional) Enter a value to define the maximum number of chunks for a multipart upload in **Maximum Upload Ports**.
   Setting a maximum is necessary if a service does not support the 10,000-chunk AWS S3 specification.

6. (Optional) Select **Advanced Settings** to display the endpoint settings.

   a. Enter the [S3 API endpoint URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteEndpoints.html) in **Endpoint URL**.

      To use the default endpoint for the region and automatically fetch available buckets leave this field blank.
      For more information refer to the AWS Documentation for a list of [Simple Storage Service Website Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_website_region_endpoints%20%20target=).

   b. Enter an [AWS resources in a geographic area](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html) in **Region**.

      To detect the correct public region for the selected bucket leave the field blank.
      Entering a private region name allows interaction with Amazon buckets created in that region.

   c. (Optional) Configure a custom endpoint URL.

   d. (Optional) Select **Disable Endpoint Region** to prevent automatic detection of the bucket region.
      Enable only if your AWS provider does not support regions.

   d. (Optional) Select **Use Signature Version 2** to force using signature version 2 with the custom endpoint URL.
      Select only if your AWS provider does not support default version 4 signatures.
      For more information on using this to sign API requests see [Signature Version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-2.html).

7. Click **Verify Credentials** to check your credentials for any issues.

8. Click **Save**

## Adding Cloud Credentials that Authenticate with OAuth
Cloud storage providers using OAuth as an authentication method are Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, pCloud, and Yandex.
Some providers like Google Drive and pCloud use additional settings to authenticate credentials.

## Adding BackBlaze B2 Cloud Credentials
BackBlaze B2 uses an application key and key ID to authenticate credentials.

Open the **Cloud Credentials** screen, select **BackBlaze B2** in **Provider**, enter a name and then:

1. Log into the BackBlaze account, go to the **App Keys** page, and add a new application key. Copy and paste this into **Key ID**.

2. Generate a new application key on the BackBlaze B2 website.
   From the **App Keys** page, add a new application key. Copy the application Key string **Application Key**.

3. Click **Verify Credentials**.

4. Click **Save**.

## Adding Google Cloud Storage Credentials
Google Cloud Storage uses a service account JSON file to authenticate credentials.

Open the **Cloud Credentials** screen, select **Google Cloud Storage** in **Provider**, enter a name and then:

1. Go to your Google Cloud Storage website to download this file to the TrueNAS server.
   The [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) creates the file.

2. Click **Choose File** to browse the server to locate the downloaded JSON file and upload it. The file populates **Preview JSON Service Account Key** 
   For help uploading a Google Service Account credential file [click here](https://rclone.org/googlecloudstorage/#service-account-support).

3. Click **Verify Credentials**.

4. Click **Save**.

## Adding OpenStack Swift Cloud Credentials
