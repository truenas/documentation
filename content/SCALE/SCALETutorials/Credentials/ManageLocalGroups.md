TrueNAS offers groups as an efficient way to manage permissions for many similar user accounts.
See [Users]({{< relref "ManageLocalUsersSCALE.md" >}}) for managing users.
The interface lets you manage UNIX-style groups.
If the network uses a directory service, import the existing account information using the instructions in [Active Directory]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}).

## View Existing Groups

To see saved groups, go to **Credentials > Groups**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Credentials/GroupsListedSCALE.png" alt="Groups Screen" id="Groups Screen" >}}

By default, TrueNAS hides the system built-in groups.
To see built-in groups, click the **Show Built-In Groups** toggle. The toggle turns blue and all built-in groups display. Click the **Show Built-In Groups** toggle again to show only non-built-in groups on the system.

## Adding a New Group

To create a group, go to **Credentials > Groups** and click **Add**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Credentials/AddGroupGIDConfigSCALE.png" alt="Add Group Screen" id="Add Group Screen" >}}

Enter a unique number for the group ID in **GID** that TrueNAS uses to identify a Unix group.
Enter a number above 3000 for a group with user accounts or enter the default port number as the GID for a system service.

Enter a name for the group.
The group name cannot begin with a hyphen (-) or contain a space, tab, or any of these characters: colon (:), plus (+), ampersand (&), hash (#), percent (%), carat (^), open or close parentheses ( ), exclamation mark (!), at symbol (@), tilde (~), asterisk (*), question mark (?) greater or less than (<) (>), equal (=).
You can only use the dollar sign ($) as the last character in a group name.

If required, set the [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/) permissions to assign this group.

To allow Samba permissions and authentication to use this group, select **Samba Authentication**.

To allow more than one group to have the same group ID (not recommended), select **Allow Duplicate GIDs**.
Use only if absolutely necessary, as duplicate GIDs can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Managing Groups

Click anywhere on a row to expand that group and show the group management buttons.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Credentials/GroupsListedExpandedSCALE.png" alt="Expanded Group Screen" id="Expanded Group Screen" >}}

Use [**Members**](#update-members) to manage membership and [**Edit**](#edit-group) or **Delete** to manage the group.

### Update Members

To manage group membership, go to **Credentials > Groups**, expand the group entry, and click **Members** to open the **Update Members** screen.

To add a user account to the group, select the user and then click the right arrow <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true" title="Right Arrow"></i>.

To remove a user account from the group, select the user and then click the left arrow <i class="fa fa-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true" title="Left Arrow"></i>.

To select multiple users, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and click on each entry.

Click **Save**.

### Edit Group
