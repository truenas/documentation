Silver and Gold level Support customers can also enable Proactive Support on their hardware to automatically notify iXsystems if an issue occurs.
To find more details about the different Warranty and Service Level Agreement (SLA) options available, see [iXsystems Support](https://www.ixsystems.com/support/).

When the system is ready to be in production, update the status by selecting **This is a production system** and then click the **Proceed** button.
This sends an email to iXsystems declaring that the system is in production.

While not required for declaring the system is in production, TrueNAS has the option to include an initial debug with the email that can assist support in the future.

## Setting Up Proactive Support
Silver/Gold Coverage Customers can enable iXsystems Proactive Support.
This feature automatically emails iXsystems when certain conditions occur in a TrueNAS system.

To configure proactive support, click **Get Support** on the **Support** widget located on the **System > General Settings** screen.
Select **Proactive Support** from the dropdown list.
