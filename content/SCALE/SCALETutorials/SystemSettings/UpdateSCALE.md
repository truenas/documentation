TrueNAS has several software branches (linear update paths) known as trains. If TrueNAS is in a prerelease train it can have various preview/early build releases of the software.

The **Update Screen** only displays the current train.
When looking to upgrade TrueNAS to a new major version, make sure to upgrade TrueNAS along the path of major versions until the system is on the desired major version release.
For more information on other available trains and the upgrade path from one version to the next, see [Software Releases](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasupgrades/).

{{< hint type=warning >}}
See the [Software Status](https://www.truenas.com/software-status/) page for the latest recommendations for software usage.
Do not change to a prerelease or nightly release unless the system is intended to permanently remain on early versions and is not storing any critical data.

If you are using a non-production train, be prepared to experience bugs or other problems.
Testers are encouraged to submit bug reports and debug files.
For information on how to file an issue ticket see [Filing an Issue Ticket in TrueNAS]({{< relref "FileIssueSCALE.md" >}}).
{{< /hint >}}

The TrueNAS **Update** screen provides users with two different methods to update the system, automatic or manual.

We recommend updating TrueNAS when the system is idle (no clients connected, no disk activity, no ongoing S.M.A.R.T. tests, etc.).
The system restarts after an upgrade.
Update during scheduled maintenance times to avoid disrupting user activities.

{{< hint type=important >}}
All auxiliary parameters are subject to change between major versions of TrueNAS due to security and development issues.
We recommend removing all auxiliary parameters from TrueNAS configurations before upgrading.

## Performing an Automatic Update

If an update is available, click **Apply Pending Update** to install it.

Click **Confirm**, then **Continue** to start the automatic installation process.
TrueNAS downloads the configuration file and the update file, then starts the install.

## Performing a Manual Update

If the system detects an available update, to do a manual update click **Download Updates** and wait for the file to download to your system.

## Update Progress

When a system update starts, <span class="iconify" data-icon="ic:sharp-system-update-alt" style="font-size:150%;"></span> appears in the toolbar at the top of the UI.
Click the icon to see the current status of the update and which TrueNAS administrative account initiated the update.
