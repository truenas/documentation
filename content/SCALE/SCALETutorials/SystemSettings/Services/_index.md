**System > Services** displays each system component that runs continuously in the background. These typically control data-sharing or other external access to the system. Individual services have configuration screens and activation toggles, and you can set them to run automatically.

Documented services related to data sharing or automated tasks are in their respective [Shares]({{< ref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Shares" >}}) and [Tasks]({{< ref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/DataProtection" >}}) articles.
