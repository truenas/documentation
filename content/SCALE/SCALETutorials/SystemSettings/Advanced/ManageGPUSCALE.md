Systems with more than one graphics processing unit (GPU) installed can isolate additional GPU device(s) from the host operating system (OS) and allocate them for use by a virtual machine (VM).
Isolated GPU devices are unavailable to the OS and for [allocation to applications]({{< relref "/content/TruenasApps/_index.md#allocating-gpu" >}}).

{{< include file="/static/includes/AdvancedSettingsWarningSCALE.md" >}}

The **Isolated GPU Device(s)** widget on the **System > Advanced Settings** screen shows configured isolated GPU device(s).

## Isolating GPU Device(s)

To isolate a GPU, you must have at least two in your system; one available to the host system for system functions and the other available to isolate for use by a VM.
One isolated GPU device can be used by a single VM.
Isolated GPU cannot be allocated to applications.

To allocate an isolated GPU device, select it while creating or editing VM configuration.
When allocated to a VM, the isolated GPU connects to the VM as if it were physically installed in that VM and becomes unavailable for any other allocations.

Click **Configure** on the **Isolated GPU Device(s)** widget to open the **Isolate GPU PCI Ids** screen, where you can select a GPU device to isolate.

Select the GPU device(s) to isolate from the dropdown list.

Click **Save**.

{{< hint type=info title="Reboot Required" >}}
Reboot the system after adding or removing a GPU from isolation to ensure the device isolation status is fully updated.
