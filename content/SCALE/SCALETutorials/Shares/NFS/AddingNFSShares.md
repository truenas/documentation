## About UNIX (NFS) Shares

Creating a Network File System (NFS) share on TrueNAS makes a lot of data available for anyone with share access.
Depending on the share configuration, it can restrict users to read or write privileges.

## Creating an NFS Share
Go to **Shares > Unix (NFS) Shares** and click **Add** to open the **Add NFS** configuration screen.

![SharingNFSAddSCALE](/images/SCALE/22.12/SharingNFSAddSCALE.png "Services NFS Add")

Click **Add** to display **Add paths** settings, and then enter the path or use the <span class="material-icons">arrow_right</span> icon to the left of **<span class="material-icons">folder</span>/mnt** to locate the dataset and populate the path.

You can enter an optional text to help identify the share in **Description**.
Click **Save** to create the share.

After adding the first NFS share, the system opens an enable service dialog. 

![SharingNFSEnableServiceDialog](/images/SCALE/22.12/SharingNFSEnableServiceDialog.png "Unix (NFS) Share Widget")

**Enable Service** turns the NFS service on and changes the toolbar status to **Running**. 
If you wish to create the share but not immediately enable it, select **Cancel**.

### Adding NFS Share Network and Hosts

If you want to enter allowed networks, click **Add** to the right of **Add Networks**. 
Enter an IP address in the **Authorized Networks** field and select the mask CIDR notation. 
Click **Add** for each network address and CIDR you want to define as an authorized network. 
Defining an authorized network restricts access to all other networks. Leave empty to allow all networks. 

If you want to enter allowed systems, click **Add** to the right of **Add hosts**. 
Enter a host name or IP address to allow that system access to the NFS share. 
Click **Add** for each allowed system you want to define. 
Defining authorized systems restricts access to all other systems. 
Leave the field empty to allow all systems access to the share. 

### Adjusting Access Permissions

{{< hint warning >}}
You must set either `Maproot User` and `Maproot Group` OR `Mapall User` and `Mapall Group` to be able to write to an NFS share.

This is due to a known issue, see: [DOCS-3171](https://github.com/truenas/documentation/pull/1280)
{{< /hint >}}

If you want to tune the NFS share access permissions or define authorized networks, click **Advanced Options**.

![AddNFSAdvancedOptionsAccessSettings](/images/SCALE/22.12/AddNFSAdvancedOptionsAccessSettings.png "Add NSF Advanced Options Access Settings")

Select **Read Only** to prohibit writing to the share. 

To map user permissions to the *root* user, enter a string or select the user from the **Maproot User** dropdown list. To map the user permissions to all clients, enter a string or select the user from the **Mapall User** dropdown list.

To map group permissions to the *root* user, enter a string or select the group from the **Maproot Group** dropdown list. To map the group permissions to all clients, enter a string or select the group from the **Mapall Group** dropdown list.

## Editing an NFS Share

To edit an existing NFS share, go to **Shares > Unix Shares (NFS)** and click the share you want to edit. 
The **Edit NFS** screen settings are identical to the share creation options.

## Starting the NFS Service

To begin sharing, click the <span class="material-icons">more_vert</span> on the toolbar displays options turn the NFS service on or off. **Turn Off Service** displays if the service is running or **Turn On Service** if the service is stopped. 

![NFSWidgetOptions](/images/SCALE/22.12/NFSWidgetOptions.png "Unix (NFS) Share Widget Options")

Or you can go to **System Settings > Services**, locate **NFS** and click the toggle to running.
Select **Start Automatically** if you want NFS to activate when TrueNAS boots.

### Configuring NFS Service 

To configure NFS service settings click <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure">edit</i> on the **System Settings > Services** screen.

Unless you need a specific setting, we recommend using the default NFS settings.

When TrueNAS is already connected to [Active Directory]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}), setting **NFSv4** and **Require Kerberos for NFSv4** also requires a [Kerberos Keytab]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}). 

## Connecting to the NFS Share

Although you can connect to an NFS share with various operating systems, it is recommended to use a Linux/Unix operating system.

First, download the `nfs-common` kernel module.
You can do this using the installed distribution package manager.
For example, on Ubuntu/Debian, enter command `sudo apt-get install nfs-common` in the terminal.

After installing the module, connect to an NFS share by entering command `sudo mount -t nfs {IPaddressOfTrueNASsystem}:{path/to/nfsShare} {localMountPoint}`.
Where *{IPaddressOfTrueNASsystem}* is the remote TrueNAS system IP address that contains the NFS share, *{path/to/nfsShare}* is the path to the NFS share on the TrueNAS system, and *{localMountPoint}* is a local directory on the host system configured for the mounted NFS share.
For example, `sudo mount -t nfs 10.239.15.110:/mnt/Pool1/NFS_Share /mnt` mounts the NFS share *NFS_Share* to the local directory */mnt*.

You can also use the linux `nconnect` function to let your NFS mount to support multiple TCP connections. 
To enable `nconnect`, enter command `sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,nconnect=16 {IPaddressOfTrueNASsystem}:{path/to/nfsShare} {localMountPoint}`. 
Where *{IPaddressOfTrueNASsystem}*, *{path/to/nfsShare}*, and *{localMountPoint}* are the same you used when connecting to the share.
For example, `sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,nconnect=16 10.239.15.110:/mnt/Pool1/NFS_Share /mnt`.

By default, anyone that connects to the NFS share only has read permission.
To change the default permissions, edit the share, open the **Advanced Options**, and change the **Access** settings.

{{< hint warning >}}
ESXI 6.7 or later is required for read/write functionality with NFSv4 shares.
