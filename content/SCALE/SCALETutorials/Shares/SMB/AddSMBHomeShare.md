## Setting Up SMB Home Shares

TrueNAS offers the **Use as Home Share** option for organizations or SMEs that want to use a single SMB share to provide a personal directory to every user account.
Each user is given a personal home directory when connecting to the share.
These home directories are not accessible by other users.
Only one share can be used as the home share, but other non-home shares can be created.

Creating an SMB home share requires configuring the system storage and joining Active Directory.

### Creating a Pool and Joining Active Directory

First, go to **Storage** and [create a pool]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Storage/Pools/CreatePoolSCALE.md" >}}).

Next, [set up the Active Directory]({{< relref "/SCALE/scaletutorials/credentials/directoryservices/configadscale.md" >}}) that you want to share resources with over your network.

### Setting Dataset Permissions

Go to **Datasets** and click on the root dataset in the pool you just created, then click **Add Dataset**.

Name the dataset and set **Share Type** to **SMB**. Click **Save**.

Click on the new dataset.
Click **Edit** on the **Permissions** widget.

Click the **Owner Group** dropdown list and change the owning group to your Active Directory domain admins.

Click **Use an ACL Preset** and choose **NFS4_HOME**. Then, click **Continue**.

### Creating the Share

Go to **Shares > Windows (SMB) Shares** and click **Add**. 

Set the **Path** to the prepared dataset. 

The **Name** automatically becomes identical to the dataset. Leave this as the default. 
If you change the name follow the naming conventions for:
* [Files and directories](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions)
* [Share names](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fscc/dc9978d7-6299-4c5a-a22d-a039cdc716ea) 

Set the **Purpose** to **No presets**, then click **Advanced Options** and set **Use as Home Share**. Click **Save**.

Enable the **SMB** service in **System Settings > Services** to make the share is available on your network.

### Adding Users

Go to **Credentials > Local Users** and click **Add**. 
Create a new user name and password. 
By default, the user **Home Directory** title comes from the user account name and is added as a new subdirectory of **Home_Share_Dataset**.

If existing users require access to the home share, go to **Credentials > Local Users** and edit an existing account.

Adjust the user home directory to the appropriate dataset and give it a name to create their own directory.

After adding the user accounts and configuring permissions, users can log in to the share and see a folder matching their user name.
