TrueNAS SCALE advanced replication tasks allows users to create one-time or regularly scheduled snapshots of data stored in pools, datasets or zvols on their SCALE system as a way to back up stored data. 
When properly configured and scheduled, advanced replication takes regular snapshots of storage pools or datasets and saves them in the destination location either on the same system or a different system.
