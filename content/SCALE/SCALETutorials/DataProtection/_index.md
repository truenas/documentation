The **Data Protection** screen task widgets allows users to set up multiple redundant tasks to protect and/or backup data in case of drive failure.
The screen shows **No Data Protection Tasks**, a message, and **Create Pool** until you add the first pool to your system.
After adding a pool, the screen shows a description of each task in the widgets until you configure a task.
Configured tasks are listed in the corresponding task widgets with details about, and the status of the task.
