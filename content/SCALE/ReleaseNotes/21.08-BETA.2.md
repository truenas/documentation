**October 8, 2021**

TrueNAS SCALE 21.08-BETA.2 has been released! This is a maintenance release that includes an undisclosed security update and improvements for SMB/NFSv4 protocols while development looks ahead to the upcoming SCALE 22.02-RC.1 release later this month.

We appreciate the [community feedback](https://www.truenas.com/community/forums/truenas-scale-discussion/) and [bug reports](https://jira.ixsystems.com/) and hope to get all those features to RELEASE quality faster. A special thanks also goes to the large number of awesome community members who joined the development and test team. We’ve really appreciated your contributions and teamwork and it has greatly contributed to the accelerated development process.
