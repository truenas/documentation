**April 22, 2021**

After a very successful development cycle with thousands of downloads and deployments, iXsystems is pleased to announce TrueNAS SCALE 21.04 is now available!  This release is planned to be the last ALPHA version on the path toward BETA.  TrueNAS SCALE 21.04 is based on Debian “Bullseye” Linux and includes:

<ul style="list-style: none;">
  <li><b>KVM Virtualization</b>: Mature Hypervisor with good reliability, Guest OS support, and enterprise features. This hypervisor is performing well in the field with our early adopters. In a future version, we plan to <a href='https://kubevirt.io/'>integrate it with Kubernetes</a> so that VMs and containers can be deployed from a common user interface and API.</li>
  <li><b>Kubernetes</b>: 3rd Party Applications can now be deployed as a single (docker) image or “pods” of containers. Using Helm Charts, complex applications can now be easily deployed with dynamic charts, giving users fine-grained control and flexibility. TrueNAS SCALE 21.04 now includes the ability to utilize community-provided catalogs, including <a href='https://github.com/truecharts/apps'>TrueCharts</a>.</li> 
  <li><b>GPU Passthrough</b>: SCALE 21.02 introduced Intel QuickSync GPU passthrough to containers. 21.04 improves this support by bringing NVIDIA GPU/CUDA passthrough to the UI and containers as well. Now containers which have GPU offload capabilities, such as Plex, can take advantage of a wider-range of GPU hardware. The sharing of GPU resources across multiple containers simultaneously is also supported.</li>
  <li><b>Scale-out ZFS</b>: Cluster volumes which span multiple nodes and ZFS pools can be created to provide scalable and robust data stores. The web UI for these is included  in TrueCommand 2.0 which is <a href='https://www.truenas.com/docs/truecommand/devnotes/#nightly-docker-images'>available as a nightly image</a>.  
</ul>

The UI, while similar to TrueNAS CORE, has also been improved with some new UX enhancements across the ‘Data Protection’ and ’Sharing’ sub-sections. Further UX improvements are expected to arrive in version 21.06.  

In the 21.02 version, we also introduced the new [TrueNAS CLI](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/introducing-the-new-truenas-cli.90741/) that uses the API and persists all changes. This CLI will make it easier to script the set-up and configuration of TrueNAS.  Feedback on the CLI has been very positive and provided much help in us rapidly maturing it for field-use.

In March, the [TrueNAS CORE documentation](https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/) received a major facelift which greatly improved navigation and ease of use. TrueNAS SCALE documentation is taking shape as a clone of TrueNAS CORE. [TrueNAS SCALE documentation](https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/scale/) is minimal at the moment and relies on its similarity to TrueNAS CORE in addition to the [Developer Notes]({{< relref "/SCALE/DevNotes.md" >}}) and [Release Notes]({{< relref "/SCALE/ReleaseNotes/_index.md" >}}) 

We appreciate the [community feedback](https://www.ixsystems.com/community/forums/truenas-scale-discussion/) and [bug reports](https://jira.ixsystems.com/) and hope to get SCALE to production quality faster. A special thanks also goes to the large number of community members who joined the development and test team. We’ve really enjoyed your contributions and teamwork and it has greatly contributed to the accelerated development process.
