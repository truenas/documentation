Now that you have installed and configured TrueNAS SCALE, you can log in to the web interface and begin managing data!

{{< expand "Can I configure TrueNAS SCALE using a CLI?" "v" >}}
After installing TrueNAS, you can configure and use the system through the web interface.

{{< hint warning >}}
**Important:** Use only the web interface to make configuration changes to the system.
{{< /hint >}}

By default, using the command-line interface (CLI) to modify the system **does not modify the settings database**.
If users make any changes in the command line, the sytem will revert to the original database settings when it restarts.
TrueNAS automatically creates a number of ways to access the web interface, but you might need to adjust the default settings to better fit the system in your network environment.

## Web Interface Access

By default, fresh installs of TrueNAS SCALE provide a default address for logging in to the web interface.
To view the web interface IP address or reconfigure web interface access, connect a monitor and keyboard to your TrueNAS system or connect with IPMI for out-of-band system management.

When powering on a TrueNAS system, the system attempts to connect to a DHCP server from all live interfaces and provide access to the web interface.
On networks that support Multicast Domain Name Services (mDNS), the system can use a hostname and domain to access the TrueNAS web interface.
By default, TrueNAS uses the hostname and domain *truenas.local*.
To change the hostname and domain in the web interface, go to **Network** and click *Settings* in the *Global Configuration* window.

To access the web interface using an IP address, use the one that the Console Setup Menu generated after installing SCALE, or use the one you configured in the [Post-install Configuration article]({{< relref "Post-installConfiguration.md" >}}) if you upgraded from CORE.

If you need to, you can reset the root password in the TrueNAS console setup menu, or in the web interface by going to **Credentials > Local Users** and editing the Root user.

## Logging In

On a computer that can access the same network as the TrueNAS system, enter the hostname and domain or IP address in a web browser to connect to the web interface.

![LoginSCALE](/images/SCALE/LoginSCALE.png "TrueNAS SCALE Login Screen")

Enter the `root` username and account password that you created during installation.

{{< expand "Troubleshooting" "v" >}}
If the user interface is not accessible by IP address from a browser, check these things:

* If the browser configuration has proxy settings enabled, disable them and try connecting again.
* If the page does not load, make sure that a `ping` reaches the TrueNAS system IP address. If the IP address is in a private range, you must access it from within that private network.

If the web interface displays but seems unresponsive or incomplete:

* Make sure the browser allows cookies, Javascript, and custom fonts from the TrueNAS system.
* Try a different browser. We recommend Firefox.

If the UI becomes unresponsive after an upgrade or other system operation, clear the site data and refresh the browser (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>).

## Dashboard

After logging in, you will see the system **Dashboard**.
The dashboard displays basic information about the installed version, systems component usage, and network traffic. For users with compatible TrueNAS
Hardware, clicking the system image will take you to the **System Settings > Enclosure** page. 

![DashboardSCALE](/images/SCALE/DashboardSCALE.png "TrueNAS SCALE Dashboard")

The **Dashboard** provides access to all TrueNAS management options.
The top row has links to outside resources and buttons to control the system.
The left-hand column lets users navigate to the various TrueNAS Configuration screens.

Users can select which widgets appear on the dashboard by clicking *Configure*.

![ConfigureWidgetsSCALE](/images/SCALE/ConfigureWidgetsSCALE.png "Dashboard Configuration")

Buttons in the top row link to iXsystems sites, outside resources, and buttons to control the system.

![TopRowSCALE](/images/SCALE/TopRowSCALE.png "TrueNAS SCALE Dashboard Top Row Icons")

The button next to the iXsystems logo shows [TrueCommand](https://www.truenas.com/truecommand/) connection options.
The next two buttons show information about system processes, like active or previous tasks and any alerts generated by a system condition.
The remaining buttons link to system configuration option or can be used to log out, restart, or shut down the physical system.

Now that you can access the TrueNAS web interface and see all the management options, it's time to begin [storing data]({{< relref "/SCALE/Storage/_index.md" >}})!
