Now that TrueNAS SCALE is installed and configured, it's time to log in to the web interface and begin managing data!

{{< expand "Can I configure TrueNAS SCALE using a CLI?" "v" >}}
After installing TrueNAS, configuring and using the system is all managed through the web interface.
It is important to only use the web interface to make configuration changes to the system.
By default, using the command-line interface (CLI) to modify the system **does not modify the settings database**.
Any changes made in the command line are lost and reverted to the original database settings whenever the system restarts.
TrueNAS automatically creates a number of ways to access the web interface, but you might need to adjust the default settings to better fit the system in your network environment.

## Web Interface Access

By default, a fresh install of TrueNAS SCALE provides a default address for logging in to the web interface.
To view the web interface IP address or reconfigure web interface access, you will need to connect a monitor and keyboard to your TrueNAS system or connect with IPMI for out-of-band system management.

When powering on a TrueNAS system, the system attempts to connect to a DHCP server from all live interfaces and provide access to the web interface.
On networks that support Multicast Domain Name Services (mDNS), a hostname and domain can be used to access the TrueNAS web interface.
By default, TrueNAS is configured to use the hostname and domain *truenas.local*
You can change this after logging in to the web interface by going to **Network**, clicking *Settings* in the *Global Configuration* window, and setting a new *Hostname* and *Domain*.

To access the web interface using an IP address, use the one that the Console Setup Menu generated after installing SCALE, or use the one you configured in the [Post-install Configuration] article ({{< relref "Post-installConfiguration.md" >}}) if you upgraded from CORE.

If you need to, you can reset the root password in the TrueNAS console setup menu or in the web interface by going to **Credentials > Local Users** and editing the Root user.

## Logging In

On a computer that can access the same network as the TrueNAS system, enter the hostname and domain or IP address in a web browser to connect to the web interface.

![LoginSCALE](/images/SCALE/LoginSCALE.png "TrueNAS SCALE Login Screen")

Only the `root` username is used to log in to the web interface.
Enter the `root` account password that you created during installation.

{{< expand "Troubleshooting" "v" >}}
If the user interface is not accessible by IP address from a browser, check these things:

* Are proxy settings enabled in the browser configuration?
  If so, disable the settings and try connecting again.
* If the page does not load, make sure that a `ping` reaches the TrueNAS system IP address.
  If the address is in a private IP address range, it is only accessible from within that private network.

If the web interface is shown but seems unresponsive or incomplete:

* Make sure the browser allows cookies, Javascript, and custom fonts from the TrueNAS system.
* Try a different browser. We recommend Firefox.

If the UI becomes unresponsive after an upgrade or other system operation, clear the site data and refresh the browser (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>).

## Dashboard

After logging in, the system **Dashboard** is shown.
Basic information about the installed version, systems component usage and network traffic are all presented on this screen.  For users with compatible TrueNAS
Hardware, clicking the system image will take you to the **System > View Enclosure** page. 

![DashboardSCALE](/images/SCALE/DashboardSCALE.png "TrueNAS SCALE Dashboard")

The **Dashboard** provides access to all TrueNAS management options.
Across the top row are links to outside resources and buttons to control the system.
There is also a column of options at the left hand side of the UI for accessing the various TrueNAS Configuration screens.

Logos in the top row are links to iXsystems sites.

![TopRowSCALE](/images/SCALE/TopRowSCALE.png "TrueNAS SCALE Dashboard Top Row Icons")

The button next to the iXsystems logo shows [TrueCommand](https://www.truenas.com/truecommand/) connection options.
The next two buttons show information about what is happening on the system, like active or previous tasks and any alerts generated by a system condition.
The remaining buttons link to system configuration option or can be used to logout, restart, or shutdown the physical system.

Now that you can access the TrueNAS web interface and see all the management options, it's time to begin [storing data]({{< relref "/SCALE/Storage/_index.md" >}})!
