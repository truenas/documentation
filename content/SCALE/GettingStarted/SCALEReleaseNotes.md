### Migrating from TrueNAS CORE

{{< include file="/_includes/MigrateCOREtoSCALEWarning.md" >}}

{{< enterprise >}}
Enterprise customers with HA systems should contact iXsystems Support for assistance with migrating to TrueNAS.
{{< expand "iXsystems Support" "v" >}}
{{< include file="content/_includes/iXsystemsSupportContact.md" >}}
{{< /expand >}}
{{< /enterprise >}}

When attempting to migrate from a FreeBSD-based TrueNAS version, the general recommendation is to back up the system configuration file and use a TrueNAS **.iso** file to fresh install TrueNAS.
After install, restore the system configuration and import the pools.

Depending on the specific system configuration, this can be a straightforward or complicated process.
See the [Migration articles]({{< relref "/SCALE/GettingStarted/Migrate/_index.md" >}}) for cautions and notes about differences between each software and the migration process.

You must either clean install using an <file>iso</file> or use an upgrade file to migrate a FreeBSD-based TrueNAS system to TrueNAS 25.10 (Goldeye).
Enterprise customers should [contact Support](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/gettingstarted/migrate/migratecorehatoscaleha/#expand-1-Enterprise%20HA%20Migrations) for assistance with migration.
