After completing the installation process, you can either use the [Console setup menu]({{< relref "ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.md" >}}) to reconfigure the primary network interface with a static IP address or use the TrueNAS UI to make network changes and complete the initial configuration.

Configuring your system includes:

* Setting up your first pool
* Setting up data sharing
* Setting up backup for the system and your stored data
