{{< enterprise >}}
iXsystems TrueNAS Enterprise customers should contact iXsystems Support when their systems arrive to receive additional guidance on their next steps.

{{< expand "Contacting Support" "v" >}}
{{< include file="content/_includes/iXsystemsSupportContact.md" type="page" >}}
{{< /expand >}}
{{< /enterprise >}}

All TrueNAS SCALE users should follow these instructions to complete their initial system set up and configuration.

Use the information mentioned in the [installation preparation instructions]({{< relref "/Content/SCALE/GettingStarted/Install/_index.md" >}}) overview article for your SCALE installation type (Enterprise, non-Enterprise,or home use) to configure your network, SMTP, or directory service settings.

{{< include file="/content/_includes/RootLoginWarnSCALE.md" type="page" >}}

After a fresh install from an <file>iso</file> file, administrators log in with the admin account created during install and should no longer log in as the root user. 
After you log into SCALE with the administrator account you can begin to configure SCALE using the web interface.

## Enterprise Licenses and Proactive Support

{{< enterprise >}}

### Applying Enterprise Licenses 
TrueNAS SCALE Enterprise customers should contact iXsystems support to obtain license information for their TrueNAS system. 
To apply the license information, go to the **System Settings > General** screen and use the **[Update License]({{< relref "AddLicenseProactiveSupport.md" >}})** option on the **Support** widget (system information card).

### Setting up Proactive Support 

TrueNAS SCALE Enterprise customers with Silver or Gold Coverage support contracts have the option to configure proactive support.

Customers with appropriate support contracts can configure **[Proactive Support]({{< relref "AddLicenseProactiveSupport.md" >}})** after they apply their system license, and after acknowledging and signing the End User License Agreement (EULA).

The **Support** widget on the **System Settings > General** screen displays the **Proactive Support** option after you enter your system license.
{{< /enterprise >}}

## Setting Up Networking

After installing the SCALE <file>iso</file> file, the SCALE installer provides the DHCP-assigned IP address for the web UI and displays it at the top of the [Console Setup Menu]({{< relref "ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.md" >}}) screen. 
TrueNAS uses DHCP to assign the primary web UI IP address and provision the other required global network addresses. 
If you have more than one network interface card installed and connected to your network, you need to assign an IP address and configure it in SCALE.

{{< include file="/content/_includes/DHCPCreatedNetwork.md" type="page" >}}

{{< include file="/content/_includes/UsingConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.md" type="page" >}}

If you are unfamiliar with network services, devices, or configurations, you can find more information [here]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Network/_index.md" >}}) to help guide you through this important and required configuration area.
{{< enterprise >}}
You must disable failover in the UI on SCALE Enterprise HA systems to [add or change any network setting]({{< relref "InstallEnterpriseHASCALE.md#configure-network-settings" >}}). Complete network changes and test them, then re-enable failover.
{{< /enterprise >}}

### Adding Network Interfaces

{{< include file="MultipleInterfacesOnNetwork.md" type="page" >}}

If your system includes more than one network interface card (NIC) connected to your internal network (wired to your router or Internet access point), you can add an interface in SCALE. 
DHCP is available for only a single interface; any other physical interfaces must be configured with static IP addresses.

You can also configure virtual network interfaces such as a [bridge]({{< relref "SettingUpBridge.md" >}}), link aggregate (LAGG), or virtual LAN (VLAN) interface. 

You can use either the Console Setup Menu or SCALE UI to configure network interfaces. 
We recommend using the web UI to [add or change network interfaces or aliases]({{< relref "ManagingInterfaces.md" >}}), set up link aggregate [LAGG]({{< relref "SettingUpLAGG.md" >}}) or virtual LAN [VLAN]({{< relref "SettingUpVLAN.md" >}}) interfaces, change or [configure global network settings]({{< relref "ManagingGlobalConfig.md" >}}), or set up [static IP addresses]({{< relref "SettingUpStaticIPs.md" >}}) on the **Network** screen.

### Adding Aliases or Static IP Addresses
Static IP addresses and aliases provide different support for various network applications. 
{{< enterprise >}}
SCALE Enterprise HA systems use a virtual IP (VIP) to maintain access to the UI even if the system fails over to the standby controller. This VIP address might experience a minor blip at failover, but you do not need to log in with the standby controller IP address to gain access to the UI after a failover.
{{< /enterprise >}}
You can configure a network interface with a static IP or add an alias IP address on the same screen in the SCALE UI. 
For more information on when to use an alias or a static IP address, see [Managing Interfaces]({{< relref "ManagingInterfaces.md" >}}).

## Setting Up Storage

TrueNAS SCALE requires at least one storage pool. We recommend creating the required pool and then planning the rest of your storage needs before you move on to adding sharing, container applications, virtual machines, or begin storing data.
When planning your data storage, consider the type of data sharing you want to do, any container applications you might want to deploy, and how you want to organize stored data. 

The storage creation process begins with creating a pool and then adding the datasets or zvols as needed. Creating your initial storage is [explained here]({{< relref "SetUpStorageScale.md" >}}). 

### Setting the System Dataset

SCALE assigns the root parent dataset of the first created pool as the system dataset.
If your system has enough disks to add more pools, you can [change the system dataset]({{< relref "SCALE/SCALETutorials/SystemSettings/Advanced/_index.md" >}}) to a different root parent dataset for another pool.

## Setting Up Shares
After setting up your system storage, you can [configure data sharing]({{< relref "SetUpSharing.md" >}}) using one of the sharing protocols available in SCALE.

For more information on configuring data sharing and the three built-in share types available in SCALE:

{{< truetable >}}
| Share Type | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|
| [SMB shares]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Shares/SMB/_index.md" >}}) | Used for Windows shares and also to set up deprecated AFP sharing. |
| [NFS shares]({{< relref "AddingNFSShares.md" >}}) | Used for Linux-based shares. |
| [iSCSI shares]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Shares/iSCSI/_index.md" >}}) | Used for block shares. |
{{< /truetable >}}
 
## Configuring System Services
Services you need to configure and enable are based on those you want to deploy on your SCALE system.
All SCALE systems should enable SSH service as part of the initial UI configuration.
{{< enterprise >}}
Enterprise or SCALE systems with large numbers of disks should also enable SMART service and configure SMART testing.
SCALE Enterprise HA systems should enable and configure the failover service.
{{< /enterprise >}}
{{< expand "Configuring Services" "v" >}}
Configure and enable these services based on your SCALE system needs:

* [SSH service]({{< relref "SSHServiceSCALE.md" >}})

  Set this service to allow SSH login for administration users (admin or, if also enabled, the root user) on all SCALE systems.

* SMART service and SMART tests

  SMART service and tests are important for systems with large numbers of disks. 
  Managing systems with large numbers of disks can present challenges when determining the disk with issues if SMART service and testing is not set up.

* Failover service on SCALE Enterprise High Availability (HA) systems

  The failover service enables an HA system to fail over to the standby system controller after a disruption to the primary controller.   
  This service is not included on non-Enterprise and non-HA systems.

  Enterprise customers should not make changes to failover settings or the service on their own except when disabling failover to make changes to network settings. 
  Contact iXsystems Support for assistance before making any changes to other failover settings.

When you add data sharing the system prompts you to enable the appropriate sharing service as part of the configuration and set up process.

If your installation includes a UPS, configure and enable the UPS service as well.
{{< /expand >}}

### Setting Up SMART Testing
All systems can take advantage of the SMART service and testing if your disks support this service. 
Disks that do not support SMART testing do not display the option to set up testing.

See [Managing SMART Tests]({{< relref "SmartTestsScale.md" >}}) for information on running or managing scheduled SMART tests or [Managing Disks]({{< relref "ManagingDisks.md" >}}) for more information on running a manual test from a selected disk.

## Setting Up Backup Solutions

After completing your initial system configuration and before you begin day-to-day operations, we recommend you configure the system and data storage backup. These include:
* Save the system configuration file, [described here]({{< relref "SetUpBackupSCALE.md" >}}).
* Save or [create a new boot environment]({{< relref "ManageBootEnvironSCALE.md" >}}) to use as a restore point if system issues cause you to lose access to the SCALE UI.
* Download a system debug to capture system information to use as a comparison against future debug files. 
  To download a system debug file, go to **System Settings > Advanced** and click **Save Debug** to begin the download. 

Keep both the system configuration file and the initial system debug file in a safe location where important files are regularly backed up.
You can use the boot environment in an SSH session to restore your system to the point where you completed your system configuration and then import data or pools to recover stored data.

{{< enterprise >}}
For Enterprise customers with High Availability (HA) systems, the HA restore process requires recovering both controllers.
Contact iXsystems Support for assistance before attempting to recover your system. If you choose to restore access to controller 1 and the SCALE UI, contact iXsystems Support to get assistance with properly recovering your second controller. 

Enterprise HA customers should not start issuing CLI commands to recover the system!

Contact iXsystems Support after you restore access to controller 1 to request further assistance and before taking actions that could disrupt or damage system access further and result in requiring a complete reinstall to recover.

{{< /enterprise >}}

### Data Storage Backup Solutions
After saving both files, we recommend you set up snapshots, remote replication, or add a cloud storage provider service and set up a cloud sync task to back up your storage data.
{{< expand "Backup Solutions" "v" >}}

TrueNAS SCALE provides options to back up your stored data:
* Snapshots and periodic snapshot tasks
* Replication to another system (remote replication)
* Cloud storage provider access and cloud sync tasks 

You can take single [snapshots]({{< relref "CreatingSnapshots.md" >}}) or [schedule periodic snapshot tasks]({{< relref "PeriodicSnapshotTasksSCALE.md" >}} to capture changes to stored data without the storage overhead that comes with backing up through data replication, or you can use one of the [replication options]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/DataProtection/Replication/_index.md" >}}) SCALE provides.

Another data storage backup option is to create an account with a cloud storage service provider, then let SCALE manage the backups. 
Use the **Backup Credentials** screen **[Cloud Credentials]({{< relref "AddCloudCredentials.md" >}})** to add authentication credentials for a supported cloud service and then schedule a **[Cloud Sync Tasks]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/DataProtection/CloudSynctasks/_index.md" >}})** to regularly back up your storage data to the cloud.
{{< /expand >}}
## Checking System Alert Settings and Services
You can view system alerts, configure the alert service and settings you want to use, and enter an email account to receive alerts from SCALE from the **Alerts** dropdown panel accessed by clicking the alert icon on the top toolbar.
{{< expand "Configuring Alerts" "v" >}}
The alert icon on the [top toolbar]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/toptoolbar/_index.md" >}}) displays a red circle with a number in it if SCALE encounters a configuration error or exceeds a threshold that you set (such as a temperature or a usage level).
The **[Alerts]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/toptoolbar/alerts/_index.md" >}})** icon number indicates the number of new alerts that have occurred. 
Click on the alert icon to open the **Alerts** dropdown panel. 

The **Alerts** dropdown panel also includes a gear **Settings** icon that provides access to configuration alert services and alert settings screens and a system email account screen where you enter the address to receive messages when a system event triggers an alert.

* Click **[Alert Services]({{< relref "AlertServicesScreen.md" >}})** to configure an alert service such as PagerDuty. 
* Click **[Alert Settings]({{< relref "AlertSettingsScreen.md" >}})** to customize alert settings that determine the threshold for trigging an alert. 
* Click **[Email]({{< relref "SettingUpSystemEmail.md" >}})** to assign an email address to receive system alert notifications.

{{< enterprise >}}
The **Alert Settings** screen includes access to the Enterprise HA setting options to customize the event thresholds that produce alerts or send emails.
{{< /enterprise >}}
{{< /expand >}}

## Setting Up Directory Services
TrueNAS SCALE allows you to configure an Active Directory or LDAP server to handle authentication and authorization services, domain, and other account settings. 
SCALE allows you to configure either directory server but not both. 
{{< hint type=warning >}}
We do not recommended that you switch between directory services. This can result in configuration issues that could disrupt your system!

However, it is possible to change from either directory service to the other. If you want to migrate from LDAP to Active Directory, you must disable LDAP in SCALE and then remove the current directory server settings. To change from Active Directory to LDAP, use the **Leave Domain** option and disable the service before attempting to configure and enable LDAP.
{{< /hint >}}
{{< enterprise >}}
iXsystems Support can assist Enterprise customers with configuring directory service settings in SCALE with the [information customers provide]({{< relref "/SCALE/GettingStarted/Install/_index.md" >}}), but they cannot configure customer Active Directory system settings.
{{< /enterprise >}}
Non-Enterprise users can find support for configuring directory services in the TrueNAS Documentation Hub tutorials or in the community forums.

## Using Enclosure Management 
{{< enterprise >}}
For TrueNAS Enterprise customers with compatible hardware, the TrueNAS SCALE main **Dashboard** displays an image of the TrueNAS system server on the **System Information** widget. 
Click on the image to open the **[View Enclosure]({{< relref "EnclosureScreensSCALE" >}})** screen, or select the **System Settings > Enclosure** option on the main menu navigation panel.

The **View Enclosure** screen provides details about the system disks, the pools and VDEVs they are in, the hardware, and the disk status. Click on a drive to view the disk details.
If the TrueNAS system has an expansion shelf, an image of the expansion shelf populated with disks also displays.
{{< /enterprise >}}

If using SCALE on servers not provided by TrueNAS, the **System Information** widget on the **Dashboard** displays the TrueNAS SCALE logo and the **System Settings > Enclosure** option does not exist on the menu navigation panel.

## Using Applications in SCALE
SCALE provides a list of applications you can deploy on the **Apps > Available Applications** screen.

See the [Apps tutorials]({{< relref "/scale/scaletutorials/apps/_index.md" >}}) for procedures for generically deploying and managing apps, App catalogs, custom apps, and specific app deployment and notes.

## Updating SCALE
You can update your system with an <file>iso</file> file using the system administration console or an update file installed through the SCALE UI.

There are a few ways to find available updates for your instance of TrueNAS SCALE:
* The main **Dashboard > System Information** widget alerts you when a SCALE update is available to download and install.
  Click the update option to open the **System Settings > Updates** screen.
* Go to **System Settings > Updates** to check if an update is available.

For all update options and procedures using the SCALE UI see **[Updating SCALE]({{< relref "UpdateSCALE.md" >}})**.

Always save the system configuration file and save a new boot environment for your current release and configuration before updating to either a new incremental or full release.

It is also good practice to download a fresh debug file before and after a system update.
