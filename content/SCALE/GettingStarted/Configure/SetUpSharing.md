After setting up storage on your TrueNAS, it is time to begin sharing data!
There are several sharing solutions available on SCALE, but in this article we discuss the options to create the share and dataset from the **Shares** screens.

## Sharing Data Methods
TrueNAS SCALE provides three types of sharing methods:

* SMB for Windows shares
* NFS for Unix-like shares
* ISCSi block shares

For more information on TrueNAS SCALE shares, see the [Shares]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Shares/_index.md" >}}) tutorials.

Regardless of what type of share you create, you need to create the user and dataset for the share.

## Creating Share Users
Share users have permissions to access the share. You can create the user before or after you create the share.

Administrators can provision share users using a directory server such as Active Directory or LDAP.
The administration user can create a limited administration user with only the ability to manage shares.
See [Using Administration Logins]({{< relref "AdminRoles.md" >}}) for more information on administration roles.

To add non-SMB share users or edit users, go to **Credentials > Users** to add or edit the user(s).
Click **Add** to create a new or as many new user accounts as you need.

Enter the values in each required field, verify **Samba Authentication** is selected for SMB share users, then click **Save**.
For more information on the fields and adding users, see [Creating User Accounts]({{< relref "ManageLocalUsersScale.md" >}}).

By default, all new users are members of a built-in group called **builtin_users**.
You can use a group to grant access to all users on the server or add more groups to fine-tune permissions for large numbers of users.
This approach is particularly useful for high availability (HA) configurations and efficient data sharing across multiple users.

{{< expand "Why not just allow anonymous access to the share?" "v" >}}
Anonymous or guest access to a share is possible, but it is a security vulnerability and not recommended for Enterprise or systems with more than one share administrator account.
Using a guest account also increases the likelihood of unauthorized users gaining access to your data.

After creating the share user account(s), next create the share and dataset.
For iSCSI shares, create the dataset then the share.
You can create an SMB or NFS share while creating the dataset or create the dataset while creating the share.

This article provides instructions on creating the share and adding the dataset from **Shares** screens.

## Setting up SMB Shares for Windows
For more detailed information on adding SMB shares, see [Adding SMB Shares]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Shares/_index.md" >}}).

{{< include file="/static/includes/LocalSMBUser.md" >}}

To set up a basic SMB share from the **Add SMB** screen:
1. Create the share and dataset.

   a. Go to **Shares**, then click **Add** on the **Windows (SMB) Shares** widget to open the **Add SMB** configuration screen.

   b. Populate the **Path** screen by either selecting the path to an existing dataset mount path, or entering the path to the dataset location.
      You can use an existing dataset or create a new dataset.
      To browse to the location, click on the <i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> to the left of **mnt**, and then at the pool to expand the options.
      Continue expanding until reaching the storage location of the existing dataset or where you want to create a new dataset for the share.
      Click on the exiting dataset to populate the field with the full path, or click **Create Dataset** to enter a name for a new dataset and the share.

      {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Shares/AddSMBPath.png" alt="Add SMB Path" id="Add SMB Path" >}}
    
      {{< include file="/static/includes/FileExplorerFolderIcons.md" >}}

      Clicking **Create Dataset** opens the **Create Dataset** dialog. Enter a name and then click **Create**.
      The system creates the share and dataset, and populates both the **Path** and share **Name** fields with the name given the dataset.
      The dataset name becomes the share name.

   c. (Optional) Customize the share properties.
      You can make changes to any share using the **Advanced Options** option.
      For example, to turn on auditing, click **Enable** to set up audit logging.
      
   d. Click **Save**. TrueNAS creates the share and the dataset.

   e. Start the SMB service when prompted, or select the option to start the service if not prompted.

2. Edit the SMB share permissions to set the share owner and/or group. You can edit access permissions at the share or dataset level. 

   a. Click on <span class="material-icons">share</span> **Edit Share ACL** icon to open the **Edit Share ACL** screen.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Shares/SMBShareACLScreen.png" alt="SMB Share ACL Screen" id="SMB Share ACL Screen" >}}

   b. Select either **User** in **Who**, then the user name in **User**, and then set the permission level using **Permissions** and **Type**.

   c. (Optional) Click **Add** then select **Group**, then the group name, and set the group permissions.

   d. Click **Save**.

3. Edit the dataset for the SMB share permissions to set the share owner and/or group.
   You can edit share dataset permissions from either the **Shares** or **Datasets** screen. This step covers editing permissions from the **Shares** screen.

   a. Click on <span class="material-icons">share</span> **Edit Filesystem ACL** icon to open the **Edit ACL** screen for the dataset.

   {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Shares/SMBACLEditor.png" alt="Edit ACL Screen for Share Dataset" id="Edit ACL Screen for Share Dataset" >}}

   b. Select the **Owner** and **Group** and click **Apply Owner** and **Apply Group**.
      With **Who** set to **Owner**, set the permission level using **Permissions** and **Type**.

   c. Click **Save**. TrueNAS creates the share and the dataset.

   {{< include file="/static/includes/SMBShareMSDOSalert.md" >}}

   d. Start the share service when prompted.

4. Connect to the share. On a **Windows 10** or later system, open the **File Browsers** and then:

   a. Enter `\\` followed by the TrueNAS system name or IP address in the navigation bar. A login credentials dialog displays.

   b. Enter the TrueNAS user account credentials created on the TrueNAS system.

   c. Begin browsing the dataset.

## Setting up NFS for Unix-Like Shares
For more information on creating NFS shares, see [Adding NFS Shares]({{< relref "AddingNFSShares.md" >}}).

You can create an NFS share from either the **Add Dataset** screen while creating the dataset, or from the **Add NFS** share screen. Both options allow creating the dataset and the share at the same time.

To set up NFS sharing from the **Add NFS** screen:
1. Add additional packages like `nfs-common` to any client systems that require them.

2. Create the NFS share and dataset.

   a. Go to **Shares**, then click **Add** on the **UNIX (NFS) Share Targets** to open the **Add NFS** configuration screen.

   b. Populate the **Path** screen by either selecting the path to an existing dataset mount path, or entering the path to the dataset location.
      You can use an existing dataset or create a new dataset.
      To browse to the location, click on the <i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> to the left of **mnt**, and then at the pool to expand the options.
      Continue expanding until reaching the storage location of the existing dataset or where you want to create a new dataset for the share.
      Click on the exiting dataset to populate the field with the full path, or click **Create Dataset** to enter a name for a new dataset and the share.

      {{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Shares/AddNFSSharePath.png" alt="Add NFS Share Path" id="Add NFS Share Path" >}}

      {{< include file="/static/includes/FileExplorerFolderIcons.md" >}}

      Clicking **Create Dataset** opens the **Create Dataset** dialog. Enter a name and then click **Create**.
      The system creates the share and dataset, and populates both the **Path** and share **Name** fields with the name given the dataset.
      The dataset name becomes the share name.

   c. (Optional) Customize the share properties.
      You can make changes to any share using the **Advanced Options** option.
      For example, mapping users or groups, click **Enable** to set up audit logging.
      
   d. Click **Save**. TrueNAS creates the share and the dataset.

   e. Start the NFS service when prompted, or select the option to start the service if not prompted.

3. Access the dataset.
   On a Unix-like system, open a command line and enter command `showmount -e {IPADDRESS}` where {IPADDRESS} is your TrueNAS system IP address.

   ```
   tmoore@ChimaeraPrime:~$ showmount -e 10.238.15.194
   Export list for 10.238.15.194:
   /mnt/pool1/testds (everyone)
   ```

4. Make a local directory for the NFS mount. Enter command `sudo mkdir nfstemp/`.

   ```
   tmoore@ChimaeraPrime:~$ sudo mkdir nfstemp/
   ```

5. Mount the shared directory.
   Enter command `sudo mount -t nfs {IPADDRESS:dataset path}` where {IPADDRESS} is your system IP address and {:dataset path} is the full path displayed in step 3.b. above.

   ```
   tmoore@ChimaeraPrime:~$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.238.15.194:/mnt/pool1/testds nfstemp/
   ```

6. From here, `cd` into the local directory and view or modify the files as needed.

## Setting up an iSCSI Block Share

Setting up block sharing is a complicated scenario that requires detailed configuration steps and knowledge of your network environment.
A simple configuration is beyond the scope of this getting started guide, but detailed articles are [available in the SCALE Tutorials section]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Shares/iSCSI/_index.md" >}}).

With simple sharing now set up, you can back up your configuration and set up data backup.
