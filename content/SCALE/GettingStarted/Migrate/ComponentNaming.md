The Linux-based TrueNAS OS incorporates all the major FreeBSD-based TrueNAS storage and sharing features with a web interface based on Debian GNU/Linux.
Users might notice similarities between the Linux-based TrueNAS UI and the FreeBSD-based TrueNAS UI.
However, the switch from FreeBSD to Linux results in some differences, primarily in component naming.

## Disks

TrueNAS 13.3 or earlier utilizes a numerical listing of drives in a system.

TrueNAS 22.12 or newer uses a lettered format for drive identification.

{{< hint type=note >}}
TrueNAS 22.12 or newer still labels NVMe drives with a numeric value.

## Interfaces

{{< include file="/static/includes/NetworkPortIdentifications.md" >}}

TrueNAS 13.3 or earlier identifies bonded interfaces or link aggregations with **lagg** followed by a number (lagg1).
TrueNAS 22.12 or newer uses **bond** followed by a number (bond1).
