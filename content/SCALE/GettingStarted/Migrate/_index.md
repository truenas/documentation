On March 20, 2024, iXsystems [announced](https://www.truenas.com/blog/truenas-core-13-3-plans/) that the FreeBSD-based TrueNAS CORE platform has entered "sustaining engineering phase within the TrueNAS project."
With this transition, TrueNAS 13.0 and 13.3 continue to receive bug fixes related to stability and security.
New feature development and component improvement continues on Linux-based TrueNAS versions.

Existing TrueNAS 13.0 and 13.3 users who are comfortable with their TrueNAS system can remain on that major version.
Users looking for new feature development can sidegrade to the Linux-based TrueNAS platform at any time, preserving data and essential NAS functionality.
