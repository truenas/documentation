As part of security hardening and improving feature maintainability, there are occasions when TrueNAS SCALE features must be deprecated and removed.

This page tracks features removed in 26 and features deprecated in 26 for removal in future versions. Begin planning migrations from these features immediately and note the TrueNAS upgrade paths required when a deprecated feature is in use.
