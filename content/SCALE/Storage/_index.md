The SCALE Storage topic contains articles on importing, creating, and managing pools, creating and managing snapshots, and importaing and managing disks. 

The storage topic also has information about datasets, Zvols, permissions, and quotas.

SCALE also supports clustering storage across multiple systems. This feature is managed by TrueCommand. See [TrueCommand Clustering]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/Clustering/_index.md" >}}) for more details.
