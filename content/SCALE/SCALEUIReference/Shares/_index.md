File sharing is one of the primary benefits of a NAS. TrueNAS helps foster collaboration between users through network shares.  
TrueNAS SCALE allows users to create and configure Windows SMB shares, Unix (NFS) shares, and block (iSCSI) shares targets.

Click **Shares** on the main navigation panel to display the **Sharing** screen, which displays options to access SMB, NFS, and iSCSI shares.
