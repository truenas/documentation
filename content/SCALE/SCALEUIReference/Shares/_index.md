File sharing is one of the primary benefits of a NAS. TrueNAS helps foster collaboration between users through network shares.  
TrueNAS SCALE allows users to create and configure block (iSCSI) shares targets, Windows SMB shares, Unix (NFS) shares, and WebDAV shares. 

Click **Shares** on the main navigation panel to display the **Sharing** screen, which displays options to access SMB, NFS, iSCSI, and WebDAV shares.
