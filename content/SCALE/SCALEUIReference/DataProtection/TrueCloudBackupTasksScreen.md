The **TrueCloud Backup Tasks** widget on the **Data Protection** screen shows configured TrueCloud tasks, and provides access to configuration screens to add or schedule recurring transfers between TrueNAS and a cloud storage provider account like Storj iX.

TrueCloud backup tasks effectively back up data to remote locations, restore snapshots, and perform cloud-storage migration.

## TrueCloud Backup Tasks Widget
The **TrueCloud Backup Tasks** widget shows a list of tasks configured on the system.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/DataProtection/TrueCloudTaskSuccess.png" alt="TrueCloud Backup Tasks Widget" id="TrueCloud Backup Tasks Widget" >}}

The widget shows **No records have been added yet** until a TrueCloud task is added.

The widget header opens the [**TrueCloud Backup Tasks**](#truecloud-backup-tasks-screen) screen that lists all TrueCloud backup tasks configured on the system.

**Add** on the widget and the **TrueCloud Backup Tasks** screen opens the **[Add TrueCloud Backup Task Screen](#add-truecloud-backup-task-screen)**.

Each task on the widget shows four icons for various functions:

* <span class="material-icons">edit</span> **Edit** opens the **[Edit TrueCloud Backup Task](#edit-truecloud-backup-task-screen)** screen populated with with the settings for that task.

* <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Run Now">play_arrow</i> **Run Now** starts and runs the backup task outside of the scheduled time.

* **<i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="View Details">visibility</i> View Details** opens the [**TrueCloud Backup Tasks**](#truecloud-backup-tasks-screen) screen that lists backup tasks configured on the system. Click on a task to see details for the selected task.

* <span class="material-icons">delete</span> **Delete** opens a confirmation dialog before the system deletes the task.

**State** shows the status of the previous or current task. Possible status indications are:

* **SUCCESS** for completed tasks.
* **FAILED** if the task fails to complete.
* **RUNNING** for tasks in progress.
* **N/A** for scheduled tasks before they run.

### TrueCloud Logs Dialog
The state oval opens the **Logs** dialog for that task.
**Download Logs** saves a copy of the current task logs.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/DataProtection/TrueCloudBackupTasksScreenComplete.png" alt="TrueCloud Backup Tasks Screen" id="TrueCloud Backup Tasks Screen" >}}

Task options perform the same functions as the icons on the widget:

* <span class="material-icons">edit</span> **Edit** opens the **[Edit TrueCloud Backup Task](#edit-truecloud-backup-task-screen)** screen populated with with the settings for that task.
