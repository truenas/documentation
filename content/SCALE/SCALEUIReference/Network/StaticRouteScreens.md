The **Static Routes** widget on the **Network** screen displays static IP addresses configured as static routes. Use this to manually enter routes to network destinations outside the TrueNAS network so the router can send packets to a destination network.

TrueNAS does not have defined static routes by default.
If you need a static route to reach portions of the network, add the route by going to **Network** and clicking **Add** in the **Static Routes** window.
