The **Global Configuration** widget displays the general TrueNAS networking settings *not* specific to any interface. 

{{< hint type=note >}}
The SCALE information dislplayed on the **Global Configuration** widget is the equivalent of the information displayed on the TrueNAS CORE **Network Summary** screen. **Global Configuration** settings configuration screens are similar in both SCALE and CORE but SCALE includes external communication settings.
{{< /hint >}}

Use **Settings** to display the **Global Configuration** screen where you can add or change global network settings.

## Hostname and Domain Settings
Many of these fields have default values, but users can change them to meet local network requirements.

TrueNAS displays the **Hostname** and **Domain** in the **Dashboard** **System Information** widget. 

{{< hint type=note >}}
Some fields only display in the **Global Configuration** screen when the appropriate hardware is present.

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hostname** | Enter the system host name. The default value is **truenas**. Some applications require setting this to a value other than **truenas**. |
| **Inherit domain from DHCP** | When selected, the domain is inherited from DHCP. |
| **Hostname (TrueNAS Controller 2)** | System host name for a second controller that shows only for High Availability (HA) systems where there is a second TrueNAS controller. A name can consist of upper and lower case alphanumeric and allowed special characters dot (.) and/or dash (-). |
| **Hostname (Virtual)** | Virtual host name that shows when using a virtual host. Also used as the Kerberos principal name. Enter the fully qualified host name plus the domain name. A name can consist of upper and lower case alphanumeric and allowed special characters dot (.) and/or dash (-). |
| **Domain** | Enter a system domain name, for example, *example.com*. |
| **Additional Domains** | Enter additional domains to search. Separate entries by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Adding search domains can cause slow DNS lookups. |
