The **Credentials > Users** screen displays a list of user accounts added to the system.
By default built-in users, except for **root**, are hidden until you make them visible.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Credentials/AllUsersScreenSCALE.png" alt="Local User non-Built-in Accounts" id="Local User non-Built-in Accounts" >}}

The **Show Built-in Users** toggle shows or hides built-in users. Enable it to display the list of built-in users.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Credentials/AllUsersScreenBuiltInSCALE.png" alt="Local User Built-in Accounts" id="Local User Built-in Accounts" >}}

To hide built-in users, disable **Show Built-in Users**.

The **Users** screen shows the pre-defined administrator role assigned to the user.

**Add** opens the **[Add User](#add-or-edit-user-screens)** screen.

Click on a user row to show the user details screen.

### User Details Screen

The expanded view of each user includes details for that user, including the home directory location, shell, Samba authentication, SSH key, and sudo command access (if assigned).
It provides the option to edit or delete the user, and access user audit logs.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Credentials/UserScreenUserDetails.png" alt="Local User Details" id="Local User Details" >}}

**Edit** opens the **[Edit User](#add-or-edit-user-screens)** screen. **Delete** opens a delete confirmation dialog.

### Add or Edit User Screens

The **Add User** and **Edit User** configuration screens display the same setting options. 
Built-in users (except the **root** user) do not include the **Home Directory Permissions** settings, but all new users created, such as those for an SMB share like the **smbguest** user, do.

{{< expand "User ID and Group Settings" "v" >}}

The full path to the user home directory displays in this field on the **Edit User** screen for this user. The default location is **/var/empty**. |

### Authentication settings
**Authentication** settings specify authentication methods, the public SSH key, user administration access, and enable/disable password authentication.
The add and edit user screens grant access to a shell option, but the [privilege screen **Web Shell Access** setting]({{< relref "LocalGroupsScreens.md#PrivilegesScreen" >}}) determines the ability to see the **System > Shell** screen.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Credentials/AddUserHomeDirAuth.png" alt="Authentication Settings" id="Authentication Settings" >}}

{{< truetable >}}

Enter each command as an absolute path to the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) executable file, for example, */usr/bin/nano*. <file>/usr/bin/</file> is the default location for commands. <br> Grants limited root-like permissions for this user when using these commands.

Enter each command as an absolute path to the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) executable file, for example, */usr/bin/nano*. <file>/usr/bin/</file> is the default location for commands. <br> Grants limited root-like permissions for this user when using these commands. Exercise caution when allowing sudo commands without password prompts. We recommend limiting this privilege to trusted users and specific commands to minimize security risks. |
