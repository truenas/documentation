{{< include file="/static/includes/DirectoryServiceAccessAdmonition.md" >}}

The **Directory Services** screen contains configuration options set up access to directory servers with domain and account settings, and can set up Id mapping or Kerberos authentication and authorization service.

The screen shows the status of Active Directory and LDAP services when neither is configured, or if either is configured but disabled.
Only one directory service can be configured at a time.

Three options show by default:

* **Configure Active Directory** opens the **[Active Directory]({{< relref "ActiveDirectory.md" >}})** configuration screen.

* **Configure LDAP** opens the [**LDAP**]({{< relref "LDAP.md" >}}) configuration screen. Use to configure access to LDAP-based service such as FreeIPA.

* **Advanced Settings** opens a warning dialog before showing configuration options for [ID mapping] ({{< relref "Idmap.md" >}} and Kerberos.

After configuring Active Directory or LDAP, the **Directory Services** screen includes the widgets for each option, and adds the **Show** button to the right of **Advanced Settings**. **Show** opens the warning dialog stating incorrectly configuring advanced settings is dangerous.

**Advanced Settings**, before configuring either Active Directory or LDAP, shows a warning dialog stating incorrectly configuring advanced settings is dangerous. 
**Continue** closes the dialog and then show the **Idmap**, **Kerberos Settings**, **Kerberos Realms**, and **Kerberos Keytabs** configuration widgets.
