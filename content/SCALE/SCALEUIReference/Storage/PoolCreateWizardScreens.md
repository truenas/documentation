The **Pool Creation Wizard** configuration screens include a configuration preview and an inventory list of disks available on the system.

**Create Pool** at the top right of the **Storage Dashboard** screen opens the **Pool Creation Wizard**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizard.png" alt="Pool Creation Wizard" id="Pool Creation Wizard" >}}

**Configuration Preview** lists pool and VDEV settings that dynamically update as you configure settings in the wizard.

**Inventory** displays the number of available disks by size on the system, and this list dynamically updates as disks move to VDEVs added in the wizard.

## Pool Creation Wizard
The **Pool Creation Wizard** for most systems has seven configuration screens, numbered in sequence, to create a pool with VDEVs.
{{< enterprise>}}
Larger iXsystems-provided servers for Enterprise users equipped with expansion shelves include the additional [**Enclosure Options**](#enclosure-options) screen.
{{< /enterprise >}}

Each wizard VDEV configuration screen includes the **Automated Disk Selection** and **Advanced Options** areas.
Click **Manual Disk Selection** to open the **[Manual Selection](#manual-selection-screen)** screen.

**Back** and **Next** move to the previous or next wizard screen.
**Reset Step** clears the VDEV settings for the VDEV type selected. For example, **Data** VDEV configuration.
**Save And Go To Review** saves the current selections and goes directly to the **Review** wizard screen.

### General Info
The **General Info** area includes two default settings, **Name** and **Encryption**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardGeneralInfo.png" alt="Pool Creation Wizard General Info" id="Pool Creation Wizard General Info" >}}

**Name** is a required field.
A pool name can have up to 50 characters and must follow [ZFS naming conventions](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1448/gbcpt.html).
Use lower-case alpha characters to avoid potential problems with sharing protocols.
Names can include numbers and special characters such as underscore (_), hyphen (-), colon (:), or a period (.).
Do not begin a pool name with a special character.

**Encryption** applies key-type encryption to the pool.

{{< include file="/static/includes/EncryptionRootLevel.md" >}}

Enables [ZFS encryption](https://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.3/man8/zfs.8.html) for the pool and all datasets (or zvols) within the pool created using the TrueNAS UI.
See [Storage Encryption]({{< relref "EncryptionScale.md" >}}) for more information on using TrueNAS storage encryption.
An encryption warning dialog opens with a **Confirm** option.
**Confirm** enables the **I Understand** button. **I Understand** continues with adding the pool with encryption applied.

{{< hint type="Warning" >}}
Keep the encryption key file in a safe location where you perform regular backups.
Losing the encryption key file results in lost data you cannot recover.
{{< /hint >}}

If system disks contain data exported from pools, a warning displays with a checkbox for the pool name.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardGenInfoExportedPool.png" alt="General Info With Exported Pools" id="General Info with Exported Pools" >}}

If system disks have non-unique serial numbers, a warning displays with additional fields.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardGenInfoNonUniqueSerialNums.png" alt="Non-Unique Serial Numbers Screen" id="Non-Unique Serial Numbers Screen" >}}

**Allow non-unique serialed disks** has two options, **Allow** and **Don't Allow**.

**Allow** permits using disks with non-unique serial numbers, such as those that can occur on virtual disks.
The **Data** wizard screen shows the disks as available.
**Don't Allow** does not permit using disks with non-unique serial numbers.

{{< enterprise >}}
### Enclosure Options

The **Enclosure Options** wizard screen shows if the Enterprise system has one or more expansion shelves.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardEnclosureOptionsScreen.png" alt="Pool Creation Wizard Enclosure Options" id="Pool Creation Wizard Enclosure Options" >}}

The three radio button options apply a dispersal strategy that sets pool storage configuration topology. A *dispersal strategy* determines how the system adds disks by size and type to the pool VDEVs created when using the **Automated Disk Selection** option. Enclosures in the options below refer to the disk enclosures in the expansion shelves and system chassis.

* **No Enclosure Dispersal Strategy** does not apply a dispersal strategy and does not show additional options.
  Disks added to the pool VDEVs are assigned in sequence based on disk availability but are not balanced across all enclosures.

* **Maximum Dispersal Strategy** applies a maximum dispersal strategy, which balances disk selection across all enclosures and available disks.
  Does not show additional options. Disks added to the pool VDEVs are spread across all available enclosure disks.

* **Limit Pool To A Single Enclosure** applies a minimum dispersal strategy.
  Shows the **Enclosure** dropdown with a list of available expansion shelf options.
  Disks added to the pool VDEVs are spread across the enclosure disks that align with the selection in **Enclosure**.

### Data Screen

The **Data** wizard screen shows options to automatically or manually add disks to a data VDEV.
A pool must have a data VDEV before you can add other types of VDEVs to the pool.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardDataScreen.png" alt="Pool Creation Wizard Data Screen" id="Pool Creation Wizard Data Screen" >}}

{{< expand "Common Pool Creation Wizard Settings" "v" >}}
The **Layout** dropdown list shows the **Stripe**, **Mirror**, **RAIDZ1**, **RAIDZ2**, **RAIDZ3**, **dRAID1**, **dRAID2**, and **dRAID3** VDEV types.

{{< include file="/static/includes/PoolCreationWizardCommonSettings.md" >}}
{{< /expand >}}

### Log (Optional)

The **Log** wizard screen settings configure a log VDEV. ZFS log devices can improve the speeds of synchronous writes.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardLogScreen.png" alt="Pool Creation Wizard Log Screen" id="Pool Creation Wizard Log Screen" >}}

{{< expand "Common Pool Creation Wizard Settings" "v" >}}
The **Layout** dropdown list includes the **Stripe** or **Mirror** types.

The **Manual Selection** screen shows settings to add a **Data** VDEV **Layout** and the individual disks available to add to the new VDEV.
You can filter disks by type or size.

**Add** places a VDEV area to populate with individual disks.

The screen shows disk icons for available disks.
The system dropdown list also shows a list of available system disks.
Use the disk filters separately or together to find disks of the same type and size.
Drag disks to the VDEV to add them.

**Save Selection** creates the VDEV and closes the window.
