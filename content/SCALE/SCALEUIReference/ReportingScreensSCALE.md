The **Reporting** screen displays graphs of system information for CPU, disk, memory, network, NFS, partition, target, UPS, ZFS, and system functions.
Use the dropdown in the upper right corner to select between reporting graph display options.
The **CPU** report displays by default.

{{< include file="static/includes/netdatareporting.md" >}}

To configure a third-party reporting integration, such as Graphite, click **Exporters** to open the [**Reporting Exporters**](#reporting-exporters-screen) screen.

## Report Graphs
The following sections provide examples of each report graph.
There are a few controls to change the default graph view:

* The **Auto Refresh** toggle updates the graphs with the latest reporting data every few seconds.
  When active, the graph resets to the chosen **Reset Zoom** view every time the reporting data updates.
  Disable **Auto Refresh** before manually zooming in on any section of the graph.
* **Step Back** (<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:rewind"></span>) moves the graph backward in time by whatever time increment is currently active in **Reset Zoom**.
* **Step Forward** (<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:fast-forward"></span>) moves the graph forward in time by whatever time increment is currently active in **Reset Zoom**.
  The default graph view is to show the latest data, which disables this button.
* **Zoom Out** (<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:zoom-out"></span>) adjusts the time period shown in the graph between 1 Hour, 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, and 6 Month views.
* The **Reset Zoom** indicator shows which time value is active for the graph.
  The default **1 Hour** is the default (and minimum) time period that can be active.
  When **Zoom Out** is active, click **Reset Zoom** to reset the graph view to **1 Hour**.
* **Zoom In** (<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:zoom-in"></span>) adjusts the time period shown in the graph between 1 Hour, 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, and 6 Month views.
  This is active when the graph changes from the default 1 Hour view.

To manually adjust the vertical or horizontal precision of the graph, disable **Auto Refresh**, then click and drag within the graph view.
A left-to-right (or vice-versa) motion increases the horizontal view precision, while an up-to-down (or vice-versa) motion increases the vertical precision.

### CPU Graphs
Displays the **CPU Temperature**, **CPU Usage**, and **System Load** graphs.
{{< expand "Click Here for More Information" "v" >}}
CPU graphs show the amount of time spent by the CPU in various states such as executing user code, executing system code, and being idle.
Graphs of short-, mid-, and long-term load are shown, along with CPU temperature graphs.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/CPUReportingSystemLoad.png" alt="CPU Reporting System Load" id="CPU Reporting System Load" >}}

{{< /expand >}}

### Disk Graphs
Displays graphs for each selected system disk and by report type.

{{< expand "Click Here for More Information" "v" >}}
Disk graphs show read and write statistics on I/O, percent busy, latency, operations per second, pending I/O requests, and disk temperature.
Use the **Select Disks** dropdown list to select the disks and the **Select Reports** dropdown to select the report types to display.

#### Disk Report Setting Options
{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Select All** | Displays all available graphs for any or all disks selected on the **Disks** dropdown list. |
| **Disk Temperature** | Displays the minimum, maximum, and mean temperature readings for the disk selected. |
| **Disk I/O** | Displays the disk read and write I/O stats in bytes/s. |
{{< /truetable >}}

{{< hint type=important >}}
Temperature monitoring for the disk is disabled if **HDD Standby** is enabled. Check the **Storage > Disks** **Edit Disk*** configuration form for any or all disks in the system if you do not see the temperature monitoring graph.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint type=note >}}
Large petabyte systems may report storage numbers inaccurately. Storage configurations with more than 9,007,199,254,740,992 bytes will round the last 4 digits.

For example, a system with 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 bytes reports the number as 18,446,744,073,709,552,000 bytes.

## Reporting Exporters Screen
**Exporter** on the **Reporting** screen opens the **Reporting Exporter** screen.
The **Reporting Exporters** screen displays reporting exporters configured on the system.
Exporting enables TrueNAS to send Netdata reporting metrics to another time-series database.
Exporters send Netdata reporting records as JSON objects to third-party reporting collection cloud services or applications installed on servers.
For more information, see the Netdata [exporting reference guide](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/exporting/exporting-reference).

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/ReportingExportersScreen.png" alt="Reporting Exporters Screen" id="Reporting Exporters Screen" >}}

**Add** opens the **Add Reporting Exporter** screen.

### Add Reporting Exporter
Use the **Add Reporting Exporter** screen to configure third-party reporting integrations.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/Reporting/AddReportingExporter.png" alt="Add Reporting Exporter" id="Add Reporting Exporter" >}}

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Enter a unique name for the exporter configuration. If configuring multiple instances, give each a distinct name. |
| **Type** | Select the report object format. At present, **GRAPHITE** is the only current supported option. Selecting **GRAPHITE** displays the exporter configuration settings |
| **Enable** | Select to enable sending reporting data to the configured exporter. Leave the checkbox clear to disable the explorer without removing the configuration. |
{{< /truetable >}}

Additional settings populate based on the selected **Type** option.
