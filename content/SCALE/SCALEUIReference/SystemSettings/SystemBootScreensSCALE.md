The **System > Boot** screen contains options for monitoring and maintaining the TrueNAS install pool and disks.
This includes managing OS restore points, called boot environments, for the TrueNAS system.

### Boot Pool Status

The **System > Boot > Boot Pool Status** screen shows the status of the current **boot-pool**.
It includes the current status, the path, and the number of read, write and checksum errors.

The vertical ellipsis <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i> next to a device displays two options, **Attach** or **Replace**.

#### Attach Screen

Select **Use all disk space** to use the entire capacity of the new device.

## Boot Environments

Each time the system updates to a new software release, it creates a new boot environment.
You can also clone an existing boot environment to create an operating system restore point.

Each boot environment on the list includes:

* **Name** which is the name of the boot entry as it appears in the boot menu.
* **Active** that indicates which entry boots by default if a boot environment is not active. Activated environment displays **Non/Reboot**.
* **Date Created** that shows the creation date and time.
* **Space** shows the boot environment size.
* **Keep** that indicates whether TrueNAS deletes this boot environment when a system update does not have enough space to proceed.

### Batch Operations

Select the checkbox(es) for each boot environment. Displays the **Batch Operations** that allows you to delete the selected environments at one time.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/BootEnvironmentBatchListingSCALE.png" alt="Batch Operations Boot Screen" id="Batch Operations Boot Screen" >}}

The  vertical ellipsis <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i> displays a list of boot environment actions that change based on whether it is activated or not.

### Boot Environment Actions Lists

The vertical ellipsis <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i> for an environment displays actions available to that environment.
