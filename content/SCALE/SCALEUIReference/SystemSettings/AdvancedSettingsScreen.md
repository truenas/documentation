{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/AdvancedSystemSettingsAccessWidget.png" alt="Access Widget" id="Access Widget" >}}

**Terminate Other Sessions** ends all sessions except for the one you are currently using.
You can also end individual sessions by clicking the logout <span class="iconify" data-icon="PH:arrow-square-right"></span> icon next to that session if it is not the admin user session.
You must check a confirmation box before the system allows you to end sessions.

The logout button is inactive for your current session and active for all other current sessions.
It cannot be used to terminate your current session.

**Session Timeout** displays the configured token duration for your current session (default five minutes).
TrueNAS SCALE logs out user sessions that are inactive for longer than the configured token setting.
New activity resets the token counter.

If the configured session timeout is exceeded, TrueNAS SCALE displays a **Logout** dialog with the exceeded ticket lifetime value and the time that the session is scheduled to terminate.

{{< expand "Logout Dialog" "v" >}}
{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/TimeoutDialog.png" alt="Logout Dialog" id="Logout Dialog" >}}

**Extend Session** resets the token counter.
If the button is not clicked, the TrueNAS SCALE terminates the session automatically and returns to the login screen.
{{< /expand >}}

 **Configure** opens the **Token Settings** screen.

### Token Settings Screen
The **Token Settings** screen allows users to configure the **Session Timeout** for the current account.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/TokenSettingsScreen.png" alt="Token Settings Screen" id="Token Settings Screen" >}}

Select a value that fits your needs and security requirements.
Enter the value in seconds.

{{< hint type=tip >}}
The default lifetime setting is 300 seconds or five minutes.

The maximum is 2147482 seconds, or 24 days, 20 hours, 31 minutes, and 22 seconds.
{{< /hint >}}

## Allowed IP Addresses Widget
The **Allowed IP Addresses** widget displays IP addresses and networks added to the system that are allowed to use the API and UI. If this list is empty, then all IP addresses are allowed to use API and UI.

**Configure** opens the **Allowed IP Addresses** configuration screen.

{{< hint type="warning" >}}
Entering an IP address to the allowed IP address list denies access to the UI or API for all other IP addresses not listed.

Use only if you want to limit system access to a single or limited number of IP addresses. Leave the list blank to allow all IP addresses.
{{< /hint >}}

Click **Add** next to **Allowed IP Addresses** to add an entry to the allowed IP Addresses list.
Ensure the first address and/or subnet includes your current client system.

You can enter a specific IP address, for example, *192.168.1.1*, for individual access, or use an IP address with a subnet mask, like *192.168.1.0/24*, to define a range of addresses.

You can add as many addresses as needed.

Click **Save**.
A **Restart Web Service** dialog opens.
Select **Confirm** and then **Continue** to restart the web UI and apply changes.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/AdvancedSettingIsolatedGPUDeviceWidget.png" alt="Isolated GPU Device Widget" id="Isolated GPU Device Widget" >}}

**Configure** opens the **Isolated GPU PCI Ids** screen, which allows users to isolate additional GPU devices.

### Isolated GPU PCI IDs Configuration Screen
The **Isolate GPU PCI IDs** configuration screen allows you to isolate GPU devices for a virtual machine (VM).

To isolate a GPU, you must have at least two in your system; one allocated to the host system for system functions and/or applications, and the other available to isolate for use by a VM.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/IsolatedGPUPCIIDsConfigScreen.png" alt="Isolated GPU PCI Ids Screen" id="Isolated GPU PCI Ids Screen" >}}

Select the GPU device ID from the dropdown list and click **Save**.

Isolated GPU devices are reserved for use by configured applications or a VM.

To allocate an isolated GPU device, select it while creating or editing the VM configuration.
When allocated to a VM, the isolated GPU connects to the VM as if it were physically installed in that VM and becomes unavailable for any other allocations.

## Global Two Factor Authentication Widget
The **Global Two Factor Authentication** widget allows you to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for your system.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/GlobalTwoFactorAuthenticationWidget.png" alt="Global Two Factor Authentication Widget" id="Global Two Factor Authentication Settings Widget" >}}

{{< truetable >}}
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Enable Two-Factor Authentication Globally** | Select to enable 2FA for the system. |
| **Window** | Enter the number of valid passwords. Extends password validity beyond the current to the previous password(s) based on the number entered. For example, setting this to **1** means the current and previous passwords are valid. If the previous password is *a* and the current password is *b*, then both passwords are valid. If set to **2**, the current password (*c* ) and the two previous passwords (*a* and *b*) are valid. Setting this to **3** works the same. Extending the window is useful in high-latency situations. |
| **Enable Two-Factor Auth for SSH** | Select to enable 2FA for system SSH access. Leave this disabled until you complete a successful test of 2FA with the UI. |
