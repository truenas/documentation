The TrueNAS **Update** screen provides users with two different methods to update the system, automatic or manual. The screen can have up to four information panes:

* Current train
* Upgrade operation and version (only when an update is detected)
* Production/non-production release information (only when an update is detected)
* Update options

The screen displays the **Current Train** and a link to more information on the current train.
**Check for Updates Daily and Download if Available** sets TrueNAS to check the update server daily for updates on the specified train.
When selected, the system automatically downloads an update if one is available.
The refresh <span class="material-icons">refresh</span> button refreshes the information displayed on the screen.

The upgrade operation pane only displays when the system detects an update. It includes the upgrade operation information with the current release and available update release versions.

If the current train is not a production release, the screen includes a notification.

Finally, the screen includes three buttons if an update is detected: **Download Updates**, **Apply Pending Updates**, and **Install Manual Update File**.
If not detected, only the option to manually install an update file displays.
