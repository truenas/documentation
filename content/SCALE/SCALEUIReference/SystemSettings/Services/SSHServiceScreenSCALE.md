The **System Settings > Services > SSH** screen allows you to set up SSH service on TrueNAS SCALE.

Click <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure">edit</i> to open the **Services > SSH** configuration screen.

{{< hint danger >}}
Allowing external connections to TrueNAS is a security vulnerability!
Do not enable SSH unless you require external connections.
See [Security Recommendations]({{< relref "Security.md" >}}) for more security considerations when using SSH.

## SSH Basic Settings Options

The **Basic Settings** options display by default when you edit the SSH service. 
{{< expand "General Option Settings" "v" >}}

![ServicesSSHBasicSettingsGenOptionsSCALE](/images/SCALE/22.12/ServicesSSHBasicSettingsGenOptionsSCALE.png "SSH Basic Settings General Options")

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **TCP Port** | Enter the port number for SSH connection requests. |
| **Log in as Root with Password** | Allows root logins. Root logins are discouraged! Select to allow the root account to log into TrueNAS with a password. You must set and enable a password for the root account. |
| **Log in as Admin with Password** | Allows admin logins with password. You must set a password for admin. Select to allow the admin account to log into TrueNAS with a password. You must set and enable a password for the admin account. |
| **Allow Password Authentication** | Select to enable and allow using a password to authenticate the SSH login. If disabled (not selected), authentication changes to require keys for all users, and this requires [additional set up](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.55/htmldoc/Chapter8.html) on both the SSH client and server. Warning: when directory services are enabled, this setting grants access to all users the directory service imported. |
| **Allow Kerberos Authentication** | Select to allow Kerberos authentication. Ensure valid entries exist in **Directory Services > Kerberos Realms** and **Directory Services > Kerberos Keytabs** and the system can communicate with the Kerberos domain controller before enabling this option. |
| **Allow TCP Port Forwarding** | Select to allow users to bypass firewall restrictions using the SSH port [forwarding feature](https://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/ssh-port-forwarding). For best security leave disabled. |

### SSH Advanced Settings Options
**Advanced Settings** include the **General Options** settings. Advanced settings specify bind interfaces, SFTP settings, ciphers and any additional parameters you want to use.
{{< expand "Advanced Option Settings" "v" >}}

![SSHServicesAdvancedSettings](/images/SCALE/22.12/SSHServicesAdvancedSettings.png "SSH Advanced Settings Options")

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Bind Interfaces** | Select the network interface configured on your system for SSH to listen on from the dropdown list. Leave all options unselected for SSH to listen on all interfaces. |
| **Compress Connections** | Select to attempt to reduce latency over slow networks. |
| **SFTP Log Level** | Select the [syslog(3)](https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/manpages-dev/syslog.3.en.html) level of the SFTP server from the dropdown list. Options are **Quiet**, **Fatal**, **Error**, **Info**, **Verbose**, **Debug**, **Debug2** or **Debug3**. |
| **SFTP Log Facility** | Select the [syslog(3)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=syslog) facility of the SFTP server option from the dropdown list. Options are **Daemon**, **User**, **Auth** and **Local 0** through **Local7**. |
| **Weak Ciphers** | Select a cypher from the dropdown list. Options are **None** or **AES128-CBC**. To allow more ciphers for [sshd(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/sshd.8.html) in addition to the defaults in [sshd_config(5)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sshd_config.5.html). Use **None** to allow unencrypted SSH connections. Use **AES128-CBC** to allow the 128-bit [Advanced Encryption Standard](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf).<br>  WARNING: These ciphers are security vulnerabilities. Only allow them in a secure network environment. |
| **Auxiliary Parameters** | Enter any [sshd_config(5)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sshd_config.5.html) options not covered in this screen. Enter one option per line. Options added are case-sensitive. Misspellings can prevent the SSH service from starting. |
