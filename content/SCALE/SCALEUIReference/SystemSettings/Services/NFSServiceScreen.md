## NFS Service Screen
The **Services > NFS** configuration screen displays settings to customize the TrueNAS NFS service.

You can access it from **System Settings > Services** screen. Locate **NFS** and click <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure">edit</i> to open the screen, or use the **Config Service** option on the **Unix (NFS) Share** widget options menu found on the main **Sharing** screen.

Select **Start Automatically** to activate NFS service when TrueNAS boots.

{{< hint type=note >}}
The NFS service does not automatically start on boot if all NFS shares are encrypted and locked.

### NFSv4 Settings

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enabled Protocols** | Select NFSv3, NFSv4, or both. If NFSv4 is selected, **NFSv3 ownership model for NFSv4** clears, allowing you to select or leave it clear. |
| **NFSv3 ownership model for NFSv4** | Becomes selectable after selecting **NFSv4**. Select when NFSv4 ACL support is needed without requiring the client and the server to sync users and groups. |
| **Require Kerberos for NFSv4** | Select to force NFS shares to fail if the Kerberos ticket is unavailable. |
{{< /truetable >}}

### Ports Settings

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **mountd(8) bind port** | Enter a port to bind [mountd(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mountd.8.html). |
| **rpc.statd(8) bind port** | Enter a port to bind [rpc.statd(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/statd.8.html). |

### Other Options Settings

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Serve UDP NFS clients** | Select if NFS clients need to use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). |
| **Allow non-root mount** | Select only if required by the NFS client to allow serving non-root mount requests. | 
| **Support >16 groups** | Select when a user is a member of more than 16 groups. This assumes group membership is configured correctly on the NFS server. | 
{{< /truetable >}}

Unless a specific setting is required, we recommend using the default NFS settings.

When TrueNAS is already connected to [Active Directory]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}), setting **NFSv4** and **Require Kerberos for NFSv4** also requires a [Kerberos Keytab]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}).
