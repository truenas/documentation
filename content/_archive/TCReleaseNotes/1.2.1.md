The TrueCommand team has released revision 1 of the 1.2 release (version 1.2.1).

This revision contains a minor fix to ensure that custom certificate authorities (CA’s) are properly loaded and used when establishing a secure connection to the NAS’s.

To update to this release:

* Docker: Simply re-run `docker pull ixsystems/truecommand` to fetch the latest version of the container, then restart the container.

* VM image: Simply restart the VM to have it re-check and pull the latest version.
