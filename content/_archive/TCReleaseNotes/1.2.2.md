The TrueCommand team is pleased to make revision 2 of the 1.2 release (version 1.2.2) available!

This revision contains these fixes:

+ A minor fix to allow importing custom certificate authorities (CAâ€™s) as text rather than just a file.
+ An important fix to ensure that triggering a DB restore operation will submit the job to the NAS.

To update to this release:

+ Docker: Re-run `docker pull ixsystems/truecommand` to fetch the latest version of the container, then restart the container.
+ VM image: Restart the VM. During boot, the VM will check for updates and pull the latest version.

Tickets can be viewed at our TrueCommand  [**Open Issues**](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/projects/TC/issues/) page.
