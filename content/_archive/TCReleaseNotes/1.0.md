The TrueCommand development team is pleased to announce the general availability of TrueCommand 1.0-RELEASE.

This is a brand-new product from iXsystems that streamlines multi-system administration for teams of system administrators and large deployments of FreeNAS and TrueNAS systems. Beta testers are encouraged to upgrade to the official release as soon as possible to enable new capabilities including handling SSL settings and connection procedures.

## Known Issues

When updating from the 1.0-Beta version of TrueCommand, the updater must be run twice to complete the process:

From the web interface: go to the Dashboard, then go back to the Administration/Updates page. Restart the update procedure. If the web interface does not show an option to start the update again, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to refresh the browser.

When updating via the command line: run `sysup -update` to restart the update procedure. Then run `shutdown -r now` to restart the system after the update has completed.
