**May 30, 2018**

The FreeNAS development team is pleased to announce the availability of the fifth update to FreeNAS 11.1.

Since this is mostly a bug fix update, no changes have been made to the 11.1-U4 version of the Guide. This update did add preliminary support for Self-Encrypting Drives. Refer to Using Self-Encrypted Drives for instructions on how to configure these devices.

Due to the proximity of the upcoming 11.2-BETA1 release, the **Try the BETA UI!** link has been removed from the login screen for 11.1-U5. Users who wish to test the new UI before BETA1 is released are encouraged to create a clone of their current boot environment, switch to the nightlies train, and update to the nightlies. This ensures that there is a stable boot environment to restart into and upgrade from, once BETA1 is released.

## Known Issues

If the *S.M.A.R.T.* service will not start,it is due to a known bug for some USB and SSD devices. To find the problematic device, look in /var/log/messages for a line similar to this one:

```
May 31 23:54:58 freenas smartd[13590]: Unable to register device /dev/da1
 (no Directive -d removable). Exiting.
```

In this example, /dev/da1 is the problematic device.  Then, go to **Storage > Volumes > View Disks**, select the problematic device, click its **Edit button**, and uncheck the Enable S.M.A.R.T. checkbox. You should now be able to start the S.M.A.R.T. service.
