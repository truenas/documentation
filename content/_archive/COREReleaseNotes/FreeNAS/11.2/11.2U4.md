**May 7, 2019**

The FreeNAS development team is pleased to announce the availability of the fourth update to FreeNAS 11.2. This is a bug fix release that also includes several fixes for security vulnerabilities.

Users of 11.2 systems are encouraged to update to 11.2-U4 using the instructions in the Guide.

## Known Issues

As an edge case, if you install another instance of an already installed plugin and that plugin installation fails, the cleanup from the failure will also delete the dataset for the first installation of that plugin.

As a workaround until this is fixed in 11.3, it is recommended that users wanting to install another version of an installed plugin perform the installation from the CLI, using the -k switch:

`iocage fetch -P -n PLUGIN_NAME -k RESTOFPARAMS`
