**February 11, 2019**

We are pleased to announce the general availability of TrueNAS 11.1-U7. This bug fix release addresses the following security vulnerabilities:

NFS has been patched to address FreeBSD-SA-18:13.nfs
Samba 4.7 has been patched to address recent CVEs
The *Enable SMB1 Support* checkbox has been added to **Services > SMB**. However, customers are cautioned to not use SMB1.

The Guide icon in the web UI now points to the online HTML documentation. The PDF version can be downloaded for offline reading.

Space reservation for VAAI for NAS has been removed. Thin volumes should be used when using an NFS datastore with vCenter.

vCenter has been removed from the web UI and will be replaced with an updated, deployable plugin which supports recent ESXi versions. Contact support for more information about obtaining, deploying, and using the vCenter plugin.

Before updating to this bug fix release, contact iXsystems Technical Support for a pre-update health check and to answer any technical questions regarding this update. You can contact Support by calling 1-855-GREP-4-iX or emailing support@ixsystems.com.
