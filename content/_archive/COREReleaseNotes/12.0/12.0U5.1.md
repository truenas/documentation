**August 17, 2021**

iXsystems is pleased to announce the general availability of TrueNAS 12.0-U5.1!
This is a performance improvement release that includes middleware updates for disk management operations.
This release builds on all the bug fixes and quality of life improvements from the [TrueNAS 12.0-U5 release]({{< ref "12.0U5" >}}).

With TrueNAS 12.0-U5.1, users will notice improved responsiveness with storage pool operations.
This improvement applies to every kind of TrueNAS deployment, but those deployments with larger disk counts will see the greatest benefit.

TrueNAS CORE and Enterprise users are encouraged to upgrade their systems to get these latest performance improvements.
Enterprise customers can contact iX Support for assistance with upgrading their TrueNAS systems.
