**April 14, 2022**

iXsystems is pleased to announce the general availability of TrueNAS 12.0-U8.1! 

For those with FreeNAS installed on your system, we recommend updating or upgrading to [FreeNAS 11.3-U5](https://download.freenas.org/) first and then upgrading to TrueNAS 12.0-U8 with a single click to retain roll-back options. While it is an easy web update, we do recommend waiting to update your system’s zpool feature flags until you are finished validating your performance and functionality.

For those with TrueNAS HA systems and support contracts, we recommend contacting iXsystems Support to schedule an upgrade. We will verify your system health, configuration, and support the upgrade process as part of the "white glove" service that comes with any support contract.

Please check out the updated [TrueNAS documentation](https://www.truenas.com/docs/) even if you don’t upgrade today. We’re extremely grateful for all the contributions received thus far and encourage more user suggestions going forward.
