TrueCommand replication management feature allows administrators to create ZFS snapshot replication tasks for TrueNAS systems managed by TrueCommand. 

## Replication Screen
If the TrueNAS system has a replication task created and scheduled it displays on the TrueCommand **Replication** screen. 
Click **Replication** to the right of **Reports** on the top toolbar to open the screen.

TrueNAS system completed replication tasks show with the **FINISHED** status, while those not yet run show **PENDING** status. 
Replication tasks created in TrueCommand also show the **PENDING** status.

To start the task before the scheduled date and time, click the <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:play"></span> **Run Now** button.

If a replication task fails, click on the **FAILED** status to see the reason the task failed.

The ability to edit an existing task is planned for a later release.
In the event of a misconfigured replication task, delete the failed task and recreate it with the configuration issue fixed.

## First Steps
TrueCommand replication management allows administrators and users with access to systems to select one or more datasets as the source to replicate to a target location as long as a snapshot exists for the dataset(s). 
Replication management does not create the initial dataset snapshot.
Just as with replication tasks created on TrueNAS systems, you must take an intial manual snapshot of the dataset or create a periodic snapshot task before you can run a replication task.

Verify the dataset has a snapshot or a snapshot task scheduled.
TrueCommand shows exsiting snapshots and snapshot tasks in the file explorer.

If the system does not show existing snapshots or snapshot tasks, use the [**Create Snapshot**]({{< relref "TrueCommandSnapshots.md" >}}) option in TrueCommand to create a one-time manual snapshot or schedule an automatic snapshot task.
You can also create the manual snapshot or automatic snapshot task in the TrueNAS system.
When creating a snapshot task in TrueCommand, that task must run and create the snapshot before you can run a replication task.

TrueCommand replication management uses the default schema **auto-%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M**.
One-time snapshots use the **manual-%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M** schema.
When creating a replication task where only a manual snapshot exists, change the schema name to **manual-%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M** when configuring the replication task.
If the replication task fails, double-check that the schema properly reflects the desired snapshot name. 

To use a snapshot task in TrueCommand, allow the automatic snapshot task to run before running the replication task.
{{< hint type=info title="Read Only Snapshots" >}}
The existing snapshot cannot be read only. Replication manager cannot add a task if you select a dataset with a read only snapshot.
{{< /hint >}} 

Verify the SSH service on the TrueNAS systems is enabled and running. 
When not enabled and running, the **Replication** screen does not populate and TrueCommand returns a variety of error messages.
Either check the SSH service setting on the TrueNAS system or go to the TrueCommand main **Dashboard**, click the <span class="iconify" data-icon="ic:round-more-vert"></span> on the system widget, then click **Services** to see the list of services enabled and running for the selected system.
Scroll down to the SSH service to see the status.

## Configuring a Replication Management Task
Click **Replication** to the right of **Reports** on the top toolbar to open the **Replication** screen.

Click **ADD REPLICATION TASK** to open the **New Replication Task** wizard.

![NewReplicationTaskSourcesScreen](/images/TrueCommand/Replication/NewReplicationTaskSourcesScreen.png "New Replication Task Sources")

Enter a name for the task, select the system from the dropdown list, and then select the source dataset(s).
Click on a dataset to select it. Click on it again to clear the selection.

Select **Recursive** to replicate all child datasets.

Select **Replicate Custom Snapshot**.
If using a one-time or manual snapshot for the replication task, change **auto-%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M** to **manual-%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M** in **Naming Schema**.

To add a second source, click **ADD SOURCE** to show another set of source fields.
Repeat the steps above to configure the second source system and dataset(s).

Click **NEXT** or on **Target** to show the **Target** screen.

Select the system and destination dataset, then click **Next** or on **Scheduler** to show the scheduler screen settings.

![NewReplicationTaskSchedulerScreen](/images/TrueCommand/Replication/NewReplicationTaskSchedulerScreen.png "New Replication Task Scheduler")

Select the period and day of week from the dropdown lists, then enter the hour and minute.
Accept the defaults to run the replication task weekly on Sunday at midnight.

Click **NEXT** or on **Confirmation** to view the replication task details.

Review the replication settings.
Click **BACK** or on the wizard screen option to return to that screen to make changes.
Click **CONFIRM** to create the task and add it to the replication task list.
