When a system is connected for the first time, TrueCommand downloads and stores a copy of the TrueNAS system configuration file.
This file records all saved system configuration credentials, tasks, and other settings and can be used to restore the settings that were in place when TrueCommand downloaded the TrueNAS configuration file.

TrueCommand automatically checks connected TrueNAS systems hourly for configuration changes.
When changes are found, TrueCommand downloads a fresh copy of the TrueNAS configuration file.
Users can create manual backups as needed.

Every day, TrueCommand checks to see if any TrueNAS configuration files stored longer than seven days can be pruned from the system.
To adjust how many days that backup files are stored, go to the **Administration** page **Configuration** tab.
Removing a TrueNAS system from TrueCommand monitoring results in any related system configuration files being compressed and archived.

## Viewing Backups
