In addition to the main TrueCommand [**Dashboard**]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/UserGuide/Dashboard.md" >}}) that shows individual system widgets (information cards) with performance information for each system managed by TrueCommand, release 3.0 introduces a new **Fleet Dashboard** with new function widgets.

![FleetDashboard](/images/TrueCommand/Dashboard/FleetDashboard.png "Fleet Dashboard")

The **Fleet Dashboard** provides an overview of system information organized into six widgets:

* [Systems](#systems-widget) - Lists each system managed by TrueCommand.
* [Alerts](#alerts-widget) - Lists alerts detected on systems managed by TrueCommand.
* [Pools](#pools-widget) - Lists all pools detected on systems managed by TrueCommand.
* [Shares](#shares-widget) - Lists all shares (SMB, NFS) detected on systems managed by TrueCommand.
* [Data Protection](#data-protection-widget) - Lists data protection tasks configured on TrueNAS systems and detected by TrueCommand.
* [S.M.A.R.T. Results](#smart-results-widget) - Shows the number of S.M.A.R.T. tests completed on TrueNAS systems and detected by TrueCommand.

To view more information on shares, replication, pools, and alerts, go to the setting menu option an open the related system or alert screen.

## Systems Widget

The **Systems** widget lists all systems added to and managed by TrueCommand.
