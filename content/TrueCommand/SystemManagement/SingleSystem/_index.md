While TrueCommand allows users to manage all of their systems on a single dashboard, it also lets users view single systems at a time. 

To manage a single system either click the name of the system in the system card or click the dashboard drop-down menu, hover over *Ungrouped*, and select the system you want to manage.

While viewing a single system, users can see various statistics like CPU, Memory, and Storage usage, as well as existing datasets and [alerts]({{< relref "AlertManage.md" >}}).

Users can create and manage storage, snapshots, and shares using the File Explorer. 

Users can also view the TrueNAS system's Manufacturer, Serial Numbers, Support Tier, Support Expiration date, Hostname, CPU, CPU Cores, Plysical Memory, OS, and Uptime by clicking on the double arrows located at the lower right corner of the System Card.

Users with adequate permissions may update the system, [configure backups]({{< relref "TrueNASConfigManage.md" >}}), and generate system audits and [reports]({{< relref "Creation.md" >}}).
