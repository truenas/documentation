While TrueCommand allows users to manage all of their systems on a single dashboard, it also lets users view single systems at a time. 

To manage a single system, click the dashboard drop-down menu, hover over *Ungrouped*, and select the system you want to manage.

While viewing a single system, users can see various statistics like CPU, Memory, and Storage usage, as well as existing datasets and alerts.

Users can also create and manage storage, snapshots, and shares using the File Explorer. 

Users with adequate permissions may update the system, configure backups, and generate system audits and reports.
