TrueCommand has a robust user management system that lets administrators personalize the experience for each user account.
You can create user accounts in the TrueCommand interface.
Alternately, LDAP can automatically create new user accounts when someone logs into TrueCommand with their LDAP credentials.

You can also manage many user accounts simultaneously by organizing them into Teams.

## Adding Local User Accounts

To create a new user account, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Users > + NEW USER**.
Assign them a descriptive name and authentication method.

TrueCommand uses the default authentication method to create unique credentials for logging in to the web interface.
User names and passwords are case-sensitive.
The administrator must provide the user with their login credentials.

You can assign users to existing teams. After creating the team, you can add the user in the **New User** configuration panel by selecting **Teams** on the drop-down menu.
You can assign users to multiple teams.

If the user needs to be an administrator, check the **TrueCommand Administrator** box.

When finished, click **Create User**.

## Configuring User Accounts

To configure account details and permissions, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Users**.

![UsersList](/images/TrueCommand/Users/UsersList.png "List of Users")

To edit a user, click the edit icon <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure">edit</i>.

![Users Edit](/images/TrueCommand/Users/UsersEditUser21.png "Users Edit")

There are several different user elements that you can configure, including their avatar, personal details, contact email address, team membership, and system permissions.

### User Details

Users or admins can add personal details about the user on this page. 

To revert to the original field contents, click **RESET FORM** before you click **SAVE CHANGES**.

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Username** | Enter or change the username. |
| **Full Name** | Enter or change the user full name. |
| **Title** | Enter or change the user title. |
| **Email** | Enter or change the user email. If [SMTP]({{< relref "AlertManage.md" >}}) is not set up, an error message displays at the bottom of the screen stating **Failed to send email. Are your SMTP settings configured?**. Admins can click the **CONFIGURE** button to open the SMTP settings window. Before adding a user email, go to **Alert Services** and verify you have set up the SMTP service. |
| **Phone** | Enter or change the user phone number. |
| **Two Factor Authentication** | Enables [Two Factor Authentication]({{< relref "truecommand/tcgettingstarted/useraccounts.md" >}}), which requires the user to enter a validation code emailed to them after they enter their username, password, and click **SIGN IN** on the login screen. |
| **TrueCommand Administrator** | Designates the account as an administrator. |
| **Password** | New user password. |
| **Password Confirm** | Confirms new user password. |
{{< /truetable >}}

### Joined Teams

The **CREATE A NEW TEAM** button displays if a TrueCommand team does not exist.
When teams exist, the **JOIN TEAM** button displays instead.

Click **JOIN TEAM** to display the list of existing teams, then select a team to add the user to it.
You can add users to multiple teams.
TrueCommand applies team permissions to any user added to a team, but setting specific permissions for users can override related team permissions.
Use the **Teams** screen to create new teams or edit existing ones.

### System Access

To limit non-administrative account access to connected systems, configure the **System Access** and **System Groups** sections.
You must first configure [system connections]({{< relref "ConnectingTrueNAS.md" >}}) and/or [system groups]({{< relref "ConnectingTrueNAS.md" >}}) in TrueCommand. Add systems from either the **Dashboard** or **Systems** screens.

{{< include file="/static/includes/TCPermissionsHierarchy.md" >}}

Click **ADD SYSTEM** and select a system from the drop-down to give the user access to that system.
To restrict them to viewing system details, select the **read** permission.
To remove their access to a particular system, click **-** minus on that system.

When TrueCommand has system groups, the **ADD GROUP** button displays.
Click **ADD GROUP** and select a group from the drop-down to give the user access to all the systems in that group.
To choose the user group permissions, select **read** or **read/write**.
To remove their access to a particular system group, click **-** (minus) on that group.

## Resetting a User Password from the Command Line

The Docker version of TrueCommand allows you to reset user passwords from the command line.
Open the **Shell** on the TrueNAS system running the TrueCommand container and use the following command, replacing the values in brackets with their appropriate values. 

```
docker exec -it [docker instance ID] resetpw [username]
```

## Deleting User Accounts

To delete an account, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Users**.
