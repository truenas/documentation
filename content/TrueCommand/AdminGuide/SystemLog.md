TrueCommand records all user activity in a system log.
For example, if a user deletes a system from TrueCommand, the log records which user deleted it, along with other information associated with the deleted system.

To view the system log, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Logs**.

TrueCommand shows all system log entries by default.
To hide specific log entry categories, select them in the **Hide** drop-down.
You can display all system logs again by clicking **SHOW ALL**.
You can also filter logs by entering strings in the **Filter** field.

Click an entry in the log to show detailed information about the event.
Clicking **DOWNLOAD ALL LOGS** downloads a <file>.json</file> file that contains all system log entries.
