The first time you log into TrueCommand you create the administrator account.

![TrueCommand Admin Creation](/images/TrueCommand/Users/FirstLogin.png "TrueCommand Admin Creation")

Enter a username and password. Both username and password are case-sensitive.

Read the Terms of Service, then select **I have read and agree to the terms of service**, and click **SIGN UP**.

TrueCommand creates the admin login credentials and displays the login page.

![TrueCommand Admin Sign In](/images/TrueCommand/Users/LoginAdmin.png "TrueCommand Admin Sign In")

You can now log in to the TrueCommand web interface with the new administrator account credentials.
