TrueCommand is versatile and offers several different install options.
TrueCommand Cloud is the preferred method for using TrueCommand since it does not require local resources or have specific hardware requirements to get started!

{{< hint type=note >}}
Please note that a credit card number is required for Cloud Signups.

If you are purchasing TrueNAS Enterprise hardware or licenses, you might be eligible to receive an additional TrueCommand license that lasts the duration of the TrueNAS Enterprise contract.
Inquire with [**iXsystems Customer Support**](https://www.ixsystems.com/support/) for more details about adding TrueCommand to your TrueNAS Enterprise purchase.
