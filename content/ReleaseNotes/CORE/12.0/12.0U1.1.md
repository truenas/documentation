**January 15, 2021**

iXsystems is pleased to announce the general availability of TrueNAS 12.0-U1.1! This is a minor version release to work around a critical ZFS issue that could impact systems with a rare but serious issue with data integrity under some very uncommon access patterns.  To date iXsystems has only observed these issues while running with some very specific virtualization workloads, however *ALL* TrueNAS 12.0 or higher users are encouraged to upgrade their systems immediately to 12.0-U1.1 out of an overabundance of caution.

TrueNAS Enterprise customers with 12.0 installed can always contact iXsystems Support for assistance upgrading their TrueNAS deployments.

## TrueNAS 12.0-U1.1 Changelog

<ul>
<li><a href="https://jira.ixsystems.com/browse/NAS-108627" target=_blank>NAS-108627</a> : While the underlying ZFS issue causing the instability is being resolved, there has been a temporary <a href="https://github.com/freenas/ports/pull/940/files" target="_blank">reversion of the ZFS CFA patch</a>. This means that Asynchronous Copy-on-Write is temporarily disabled in TrueNAS 12.0-U1.1, with the goal to re-enable this functionality in a later TrueNAS 12.0 update release after this issue has been fully resolved. </li>
</ul>
