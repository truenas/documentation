**June 8, 2021**

[TrueCommand 2.0](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truecommand/) is now available after completing its [BETA phase](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/truecommand-2-0-beta/). Significant new features include:

* Faster Time-Series Database
* Real-Time Stats & Analysis
* Storage Navigator
* iSCSI Manager
* Improved System-Down Alerts
* Secure Web-Proxy for Cloud
* TrueNAS SCALE cluster UI

TrueCommand 2.0 uses a much faster and lightweight InfluxDB instead of a PostgreSQL database. This time-series database improves general performance and specifically improves the performance of Cloud instances significantly. This extra performance gives TrueCommand the ability to monitor real-time, per-second statistics rather than the previous 30 second intervals without changing the network bandwidth significantly. These additions dramatically improve the ability to diagnose occasional performance issues and their root causes.

With all these additions, TrueCommand 2.0 is the single pane of glass for:

* **TrueNAS CORE**: Manage systems on standard servers, Minis, or even AWS.
* **TrueNAS Enterprise**: Manage X-Series and M-Series systems with High Availability.
* **TrueNAS SCALE**: Manage a group of systems running a TrueNAS SCALE cluster.

## To Update to this Release

{{< hint warning >}}
**Important Note for Upgrading from v1.3**
 
Updating from TrueCommand v1.3 to v2.0 involves a database migration process. This preserves all configuration data, but does not preserve old performance statistics.
Additionally, it is not possible to roll back to TrueCommand v1.3 from v2.0. Please use caution when upgrading production TrueCommand systems. If necessary, run TrueCommand 1.3 and TrueCommand 2.0 in parallel for a transition period. 
{{< /hint >}}
