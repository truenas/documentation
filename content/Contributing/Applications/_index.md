We welcome community user contributions, issue reporting, and suggestions for new features and apps to create the best possible TrueNAS app user experience!

## App Updates and Releases
Application maintenance is independent of TrueNAS version release cycles.
App version information, features, configuration options, and installation behavior during access might vary from those in documented tutorials.

TrueNAS apps show the **Update** badge and button on any deployed application instance on the **Installed** application screen when a new version is available.
Users can apply the update(s) individually or collectively and at a convenient time based on needs.

## Contributing to TrueNAS Application Catalogs
Users can submit changes to an existing application catalogs through:

* GitHub Contributions

  {{< hint type=note title="Coming Soon" >}}
  We are actively working on making the core application library more user-friendly. This process might involve breaking changes to the API. Therefore, please wait for an update on when you can start submitting pull requests.

  Thank you for your understanding.
  {{< /hint >}}

* Community Forum Feature Requests

  To request a feature change, go to the [TrueNAS Community Forum](https://forums.truenas.com/), and click **Feature Request**.
  Read the **About the Feature Requests category - README First** topic, then click **Open Draft** on the top right of the screen.
  Populate the new request form with the relevant information for each section, **Problem/Justification**, **Impact**, and **User Story**.
  The form guides you on populating these sections.
  Click **Create Topic** to add your suggestion to the list of topics.

  Users vote and comment on these suggestions.
  iXsystems actively monitors this channel and discusses the feasibility of each request both internally and in the forum posts.

  If approved and requested to submit a PR to add the new application, submit a PR against the [TrueNAS/Community](https://github.com/truenas/charts/tree/master/community) repository.
  Include the relevant files in the PR, including a ReadMe.txt file with any installation notes for iXsystems developers.

To see a current list of apps, visit the [TrueNAS Apps repository](https://github.com/truenas/apps) on GitHub.

## Contributing to TrueNAS Application Documentation
Community members can submit change requests or add new tutorials to the **Truenas Apps > Community Apps** tutorials section of the Documentation Hub.

For more information on submitting change requests, forking repos, and submitting PRs, see [Updating Content]({{< relref "/Contributing/Documentation/ContentUpdate.md" >}}).

### Submitting New Tutorial Articles
When submitting new tutorials or requesting changes to existing TrueNAS Documentation Hub application tutorials:
  
1. Create the PR against a forked copy of the [TrueNAS Documentation Hub public repository](https://github.com/truenas/documentation/tree/master).
  
2. Open the existing article file in the <file>/content/TrueNASApps/CommunityApps</file> directory of your local forked repository.

3. Add the new tutorial to the <file>CommunityApps</file> folder in your local copy of the repository if submitting a new tutorial.

4. Use the text editor of your choice to make changes to the [application tutorial template]({{< relref "/Contributing/Applications/AppArticleTemplate.md" >}}) as the basis for your new article.
  Article content is written in Commonmark Markdown.

5. (Optional) Save images in the **/documentation/static/images/scale/apps** folder of your local branch.

6. Submit the PR against the **Master** branch.

### Using the App Tutorial Template
Feel free to change standard article content by adding or removing sections to fit the app installation process.
Change the front matter <file>description:</file> parameter at the top of the article to suit the subject and content of the new tutorial.
Description text must not exceed 160 alphanumeric or special characters, including spaces between characters.
After updating content, delete commented-out sections providing instructions for using this template when they are no longer needed.
When documenting a **Community** train app, not delete any of the commented-out instructions in the COMMUNITY APP INTRO SNIPPETS section.

#### Formatting Tips for Content Development
Standard text emphasis:
* Apply **Bold** to UI elements seen on the screen, including field, button, and navigation option names, other descriptions, etc.
  Use double asterisks preceding and following the name or text string to make it bold.
  Do not use bold in code strings.

* Apply *Italics* to any variable.
  Use single asterisks preceding and following the name or text string to make it italics.
  If using a variable in a code example, use the HTML tags (\<i>\</i>) and not the Markdown tags.

* Apply HTML file tags (<code>\<file>\</file></code>) when entering a path to a file or file name, for example <code>\<file>iso\</file></code>, which renders as <file>iso</file>.

* Apply HTML keyboard tags (<code>\<kbd>\</kbd></code>) to keys on a keyboard, for example <code>\<kbd>Enter\</kbd></code>, which renders as <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

When entering commands, command strings, or code blocks:

* Apply backticks(<code>\`\`</code>) or HTML <code>\<code>\</code></code> tags to format command strings or output, for example <code>\`string\`</code> or <code>\<code>string\</code></code>, which render as <code>string</code>.
  
* Apply HTML <code>\<code>\</code></code> tags to strings with variables.

  * Do not enclose variables in angle or square brackets as these can also be part of command syntax.

  * Do not enter variables in all caps unless the command requires entering the value in all caps.

To create a code block, either use three backticks (<code>```</code>) on the line before and after the content block, or use the HTML code tags.

#### Using the Apps Snippet Library
When creating your articles you can use the library of snippets that contain explanations of settings and configuration instructions for the various app Install Wizard settings in your submitted content.
These snippets are maintained by the Technical Documentation team, but you can submit change requests for these files just as with full articles if you find content that needs updating or changing.

The tutorial template includes the shortcode that calls these files into the app wizard sections of the Stable Apps and Enterprise Apps tutorials in the Documentation Hub.
To use snippets where the template does not have one, enter the include file shortcode where you want to call another snippet.
The shortcode to call snippet files is <code>{{\<include&nbsp;file="/static/includes/apps/snippetFileName.md">}}</code>, where *snippetFileName.md* is the name of the snippet file.

The following table shows the current list of snippet files.
{{< expand "App Tutorial Snippet Files" "v" >}}
Snippet files are located in the <file>/documentation/static/includes/apps</file> folder.
Not all snippet files in this folder apply to tutorial content.
Refer to the tables below for a list of snippet files with content about tutorial sections.
Open and read snippet files to determine where to use them in your tutorial.
