The open-source TrueNAS project welcomes contributions to the project. We also welcome changes to articles found in the TrueNAS Documentation Hub.

Contributions to the TrueNAS open-source projects are made through GitHub. For more information see [Issue reporting]({{< ref "/contributing/IssueReporting" >}})

The Documentation hub uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create the documentation website and the [Geekdoc theme](https://geekdocs.de) for general website styling.
Articles are written in a combination of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) syntax.

Refer to the tutorials in the [Documentation section]({{< ref "/contributing/documentation" >}}) for articles designed to guide you through requesting changes or making different kinds of documentation contributions.

Article templates for general tutorial articles and new application tutorials are provided that you can copy and use to submit new articles.


Please feel free to propose changes and add new content to these articles to help others learn how to contribute to project documentation!

Want to discuss your in-progress changes or other TrueNAS contributions?
The TrueNAS contributors `#truenas-docs` Slack workspace is available for contributors to discuss their changes and help each other improve the software.
You can request to join this workspace at `truenas.slack.com`.
