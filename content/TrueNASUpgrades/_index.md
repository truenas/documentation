## Release List

{{< columns >}}

{{< tabbox name=scale-downloads defaultTab=3 >}}

<--->

{{< tabbox name=core-downloads defaultTab=3 >}}

{{< /columns >}}

Each listed release links to download files for that release.
For the latest deployment and update recommendations from iXsystems, see the [Software Status page](https://www.truenas.com/software-status/).

Bug tickets are typically accepted for the latest release of the current stable version.
Nightly builds also accept feedback and bug tickets.

### Nightly Builds

{{< include file="archive/NightlyTestWarning.md" >}}

Nightly builds are automatically published when automated testing passes.
**.iso** files are available to fresh install on disposable hardware or a virtual machine.

**.update** files are also available for manually updating an existing experimental system to a nightly build.

Your testing and feedback is always welcome!
TrueNAS nightlies have an [option in the top panel](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaleuireference/toptoolbar/#how-would-you-rate-this-page?) to submit feedback directly to the development team.
Let us know what is working well and what can be improved!

### Legacy Releases

Legacy TrueNAS versions are provided for historical context and upgrade pathways.
They are provided "as-is" and typically do not receive further maintenance releases.
Individual releases are within each major version.

Legacy releases can only be used by downloading the .iso file and freshly installing to the hardware.

## Documentation Lifecycle

This website is a repository of all documentation for TrueNAS projects and related products.
iXsystems employees maintain this documentation and provide regular updates for current and in development (future) versions of TrueNAS software.
For documentation purposes, current and future releases are those recommended by the TrueNAS [Software Status page](https://www.truenas.com/software-status/) for one or more user type.

Documentation for previous releases, that are no longer recommended for any user type, is archived and unmaintained.
See the [Documentation Archive](https://www.truenas.com/docs/archive/) for content related to these releases.

## Timelines

Releases for major versions can overlap while a new major version is working towards a stable release and the previous major version is still receiving maintenance updates.
