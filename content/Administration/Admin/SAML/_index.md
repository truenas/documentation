Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a single sign-on (SSO) standard for logging users into applications that require authentication credentials (like GitHub, G-Mail, etc.).
SSO works by transferring a known identity for a user to another location that provides services to the user.
 SAML accomplishes the transfer by exchanging digitally-signed XML documents.
 
These tutorials provide general and service specific configuration instructions to set a provider such as Okta, AuthO, OneLogin, or Google to provide TrueCommand SSO through the IDP SAML service dashboard instead of using the TrueCommand SAML sign-in option.
