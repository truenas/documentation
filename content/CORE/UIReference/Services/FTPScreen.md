File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a communication protocol. It transfers data across a computer network. Configure FTP service settings on TrueNAS using the **FTP** services screen.

| **Clients** | Enter the maximum number of simultaneous clients. |
| **Connections** | Enter the maximum number of connections per IP address. **0** is unlimited. |
| **Login Attempts** | Enter the greatest number of attempts client permitted before disconnect. Increase if users are prone to misspellings or typos. |
| **Timeout** | Enter the maximum client idle time in seconds before disconnect. Default value is **600** seconds. |

![FTPAdvancedOptionsAccessTLS](/images/CORE/Services/FTPAdvancedOptionsAccessTLS.png "Services FTP Advanced Options Access and TLS")

**Access Settings**

{{< truetable >}}
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Always Chroot** | Select to only allow users access their home directory if they are in the **wheel** group. This option increases security risk. |
| **Allow Root Login** | Select to allow root logins. Selecting this option increases security risk. Not recommended. |
| **Allow Anonymous Login** | Select to allow anonymous FTP logins with access to the directory specified in *Path*.  |
| **Allow Local User Login** | By default, only members of the *ftp* group can to log in. Select this checkbox to allow any local user to log in. |
| **Require IDENT Authentication** | Select to require IDENT authentication. Selecting this option results in timeouts when ident (or in shell `identd`) is not running on the client. |
| **File Permissions** | Select to define default permissions for newly created files. |
| **Directory Permissions** | Select to define default permissions for newly created directories. |

**TLS Settings**

{{< hint type=important >}}
Unless necessary, do not allow anonymous or root access.
For better security, enable TLS when possible.
This is effectively [FTPS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4217).
When FTP is exposed to a WAN, enable TLS.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< truetable >}}
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Enable TLS** | Select to allow encrypted connections. Requires a certificate. To create or import a certificate go to **System > Certificates**. |
| **TLS Policy** | Select the policy from the dropdown list of options. Options are **On**, **Off**, **Data**, **!Data**, **Auth**, **Ctrl**, **Ctrl + Data**, **Ctrl +!Data**, **Auth + Data** or **Auth +!Data**. Defines whether the control channel, data channel, both channels, or neither channel of an FTP session must occur over SSL/TLS. The policies are described [here](http://www.proftpd.org/docs/howto/TLS.html). |
| **TLS Allow Client Renegotiations** | Select to allow client renegotiation. This option is not recommended. Selecting this option breaks several security measures. See [mod_tls](http://www.proftpd.org/docs/contrib/mod_tls.html) for details. |
| **TLS Allow Dot Login** | If selected, TrueNAS checks the user home directory for a .tlslogin file. This file must contain one or more PEM-encoded certificates. System prompts user for password authentication if file not found. |
| **TLS Allow Per User** | If selected, allows sending a user password unencrypted. |
| **TLS Common Name Required** | Select to require the common name in the certificate match the FQDN of the host. |
| **TLS Enable Diagnostics** | Select to make logs more verbose. Useful in troubleshooting a connection. |
| **TLS Export Certificate Data** | Select to export the certificate environment variables. |
| **TLS No Certificate Request** | Select if the client cannot connect due to a problem with the certificate request. Example: the client server is unable to handle the server certificate request. |
| **TLS No Empty Fragments** | Not recommended. This option bypasses a security mechanism. |
| **TLS No Session Reuse Required** | This option reduces connection security. Only select if the client does not understand reused SSL sessions. |
| **TLS Export Standard Vars** | Select to put in place several environment variables. |
| **TLS DNS Name Required** | Select to require the client DNS name resolve to its IP address, and the cert contain the same DNS name. |
| **TLS IP Address Required** | Select to require the client certificate IP address match the client IP address. |
