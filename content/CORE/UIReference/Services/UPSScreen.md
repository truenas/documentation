An uninterruptible power supply is a hardware device that provides a backup source of power in the event of a power outage. Use the **UPS** services screen to configure a UPS for your TrueNAS.

{{< include file="/static/includes/HAUninterruptiblePowerSupplyNotice.md" >}}

**SAVE** activates after all required fields are populated.

**CANCEL** exits without saving and returns you to the **Services** screen.

Select **auto** to automatically detect and manage the USB port settings. Enter the IP address or host name of the SNMP UPS device when selecting an SNMP driver. If the **UPS Mode** field is set as **Master**, this is a required field. If set to **Slave** this field is not required. |
