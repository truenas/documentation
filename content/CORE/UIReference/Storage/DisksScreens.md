Use the **Storage > Disks** screen to add or manage disks in your TrueNAS.

![StorageDisksScreen](/images/CORE/Storage/StorageDisksScreen.png "Storage Disks Screen") 

Use the blue **Columns** button to display a list of options to modify the information displayed in the list of disks. 

Use the <span class="material-icons">arrow_forward_ios</span> expand symbol to the right of any disk on the list to expand that disk to show settings and actions for that disk.

## Disk Information Screen
The **Disks** individual disk information screen includes details about the disk settings and status. It also provides access to disk actions the user can take.

Use **EDIT** to display the **Edit Disk** screen.

Use **MANUAL TEST** to display the **Manual S.M.A.R.T. Tests** dialog where you can specify the type of test as **LONG**, **SHORT**, **CONVEYANCE** or **OFFLINE**.

Use **S.M.A.R.T. TEST RESULTS** to display the results of any S.M.A.R.T. tests executed on the system.

Use **WIPE** to delete obsolete data off an unused disk. This option does not display unless your disk is unused. See [Wiping a Disk]({{< relref "/CORE/CORETutorials/Storage/Disks/DiskWipe.md" >}}) for more information on how to use this function. 

## Edit Disk Screen
The settings on the **Edit Disk** are the same as those on the **Add Disk** screen.
