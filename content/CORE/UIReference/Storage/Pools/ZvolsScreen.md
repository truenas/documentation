Use the **Storage > Pools Add Zvol** screen to add a zvol to a pool.

**Basic Options**

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Zvol name** | Enter a short name for the zvol. Using a zvol name longer than 63-characters can prevent accessing zvols as devices. For example, a zvol with a 70-character filename or path cannot be used as an iSCSI extent. This setting is required. |
| **Comments** | Enter any notes about this zvol. |
| **Size for this zvol** | Specify size and value. Units like **t**, **TiB**, and **G** can be used. The size of the zvol can be increased later, but cannot be reduced. If the size is more than 80% of the available capacity, the creation fails with an **out of space** error unless **Force size** is also selected. |
| **Force size** | Select to force the system to create a zvol that brings a pool to over 80% capacity (not recommended). By default, the system does not create a zvol if that operation brings the pool to over 80% capacity. |
| **Sync** | Select an option from the dropdown list that sets the data write synchronization. **Inherit** sets zvol to get sync settings from the parent dataset, **Standard** uses the sync settings requested by the client software, **Always** that waits for data writes to complete,or **Disabled** that never waits for writes to complete. |
| **Compression level** | Select a compression option from the dropdown list. Select **Off** to not compress data to save space. Refer to Compression for a description of the available algorithms. |
| **ZFS Deduplication** | Do not change this setting unless instructed to do so by your iXsystems support engineer. |
| **Sparse** | Select to provide [thin provisioning]({{< relref "thinprovisioning.md" >}}). Use with caution as writes fail when the pool is low on space. |
| **Read-only** | Select an option from the dropdown list to set whether the zvol can be modified. Options are **Inherit** to get and use the parent pool or root dataset settings, **On** to prevent modifying the zvol, or **Off** to allow the zvol to be modified. |
| **Inherit** (**Encryption Options**) | Select to enable the zvol to use the encryption properties of the root dataset. |
