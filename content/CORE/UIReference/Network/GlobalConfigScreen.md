The **Network > Global Configuration** screen has all the general TrueNAS networking settings that *are not* specific to any [interface]({{< relref "/CORE/UIReference/Network/InterfacesScreen.md" >}}).

{{< hint type=warning >}}
**Disruptive Change**

Making changes to the network interface the web interface uses can result in losing connection to TrueNAS!
Fixing any misconfigured network settings might require command line knowledge or physical access to the TrueNAS system.

## Global Configuration Settings

![NetworkGlobalConfigurationScreen](/images/CORE/Network/NetworkGlobalConfigurationScreen.png "Network Global Configuration Screen")

Options are organized into several categories.

{{< expand "Can these options be configured elsewhere?" "v" >}}
Many of these interface, DNS, and gateway options are also configured in the [Console Setup Menu]({{< relref "CORE/GettingStarted/ConsoleSetupMenu.md" >}}).
Be sure to check both locations when troubleshooting network connectivity issues.

### Hostname and Domain

Many of these fields have default values you can change to meet requirements of the local network.
The **Hostname** and **Domain** field values display on the **Dashboard > System Information** card.
Some options only display when the appropriate hardware is present.

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hostname** | Enter the system host name. If an Enterprise system with two controllers, this is the first TrueNAS controller host name. Upper and lower case alphanumeric, (.) and (-) characters are allowed. |
| **Hostname (TrueNAS Controller 2)** | Enter the host name of second TrueNAS controller (for HA only). Upper and lower case alphanumeric, (.) and (-) characters are allowed. |
| **Hostname (Virtual)** | Enter the virtual host name. When using a virtual host, this is also used as the Kerberos principal name. Enter the fully qualified host name plus the domain name. Upper and lower case alphanumeric, (.) and (-) characters are allowed. |
| **Domain** | Enter the system domain name. |
| **Additional Domains** | Enter additional domains to search. Separate entries by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Adding search domains can cause slow DNS lookups |

### Service Announcement

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **NetBIOS-NS** | Select to advertise the SMB service NetBIOS name. Legacy NetBIOS name server. Can be required for legacy SMB1 clients to discover the server. When advertised, the server appears in Network Neighborhood. |
| **mDNS** | Select to use the system host name (in **Hostname**) to advertise enabled and running services. Multicast DNS. For example, this controls if the server appears under **Network** on MacOS clients.|
| **WS-Discovery** | Select to use the SMB Service **NetBIOS Name** to advertise the server to WS-Discovery clients. This causes the computer to appear in the **Network Neighborhood** of modern Windows OSes. |

### DNS Servers

{{< truetable >}}

| **Nameserver 1** | Enter the primary DNS server IP address. |
| **Nameserver 2** | Enter the secondary DNS server IP address. |
| **Nameserver 3** | Enter the tertiary DNS server IP address. |
{{< /truetable >}}

### Default Gateway

{{< truetable >}}

### Other Settings

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **HTTP Proxy** | Enter the proxy information for the network in the format http://*my.proxy.server:3128* or http://*user:password@my*.*proxy.server:3128*. |
| **Enable Netwait Feature** | Select to prevents network services from starting until the interface can ping the addresses listed in the **Netwait IP list**. |
| **Netwait IP List** | Select only appears when **Enable Netwait Feature** is set. Enter a list of IP addresses to ping. Separate entries by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Each address is tried until one is successful or the list is exhausted. Leave empty to use the default gateway. |
| **Host Name Database** | Enter the database host name. Used to add one entry per line which is appended to <file>/etc/hosts</file>. Separate entries by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Use the format *IP_address space hostname* where multiple host names can be used if separated by a space. Hosts defined here are still accessible by name even when DNS is not available. See <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=hosts">hosts</a> for additional information. |
