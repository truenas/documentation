NIS is a clientâ€“server directory service protocol. Usage scenarios include the distribution of user and host names between networked computers. 
Use the **Directory Services > NIS** screen to configure [Network Information Service](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-unix-and/0596003234/ch14s01.html) on your TrueNAS.  

{{< hint type=important >}}
NIS is limited in scalability and security.
For modern networks, [LDAP]({{< relref "/CORE/UIReference/DirectoryServices/LDAPScreen.md" >}}) has replaced NIS.
