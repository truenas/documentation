The **Reporting** screen displays graphs of system information for CPU, disk, memory, network, NFS, partition, target, UPS, ZFS and system functions.

{{< expand "What does TrueNAS use for reporting?" "v" >}}
TrueNAS uses [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/ "Graphite Homepage") for metric gathering and visualizations.

TrueNAS uses [collectd](https://collectd.org/) to provide reporting statistics.
{{< /expand >}}

Reporting data is saved to permit viewing and monitoring usage trends over time.
This data is preserved across system upgrades and restarts.

Data files are saved in <file>/var/db/collectd/rrd/</file>.

{{< hint type=important >}}
Because reporting data is frequently written it should not be stored on the boot pool or operating system device.

## Reporting Screen Display Options

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **CPU** | Displays the **CPU Temperature**, **CPU Usage**, and **System Load** graphs. |

## Interacting with Graphs

Click on and drag a certain range of the graph to expand the information displayed in that selected area in the Graph.
Click on the <i class="fa fa-search-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon to zoom in on the graph.
Click on the <i class="fa fa-search-minus" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon to zoom out on the graph.
Click the <i class="fa fa-forward" aria-hidden="true" title="Forward"></i> to move the graph forward.
Click the <i class="fa fa-backward" aria-hidden="true" title="Backward"></i> to move the graph backward.

## Graphs
{{< expand "CPU Graphs" "v" >}}
[CPU](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:CPU) graphs shows the amount of time spent by the CPU in various states such as executing user code, executing system code, and being idle.
Graphs of short-, mid-, and long-term load are shown, along with CPU temperature graphs.

{{< /expand >}}
{{< expand "Disk Graphs" "v" >}}
[Disk](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Disk)graphs shows read and write statistics on I/O, percent busy, latency, operations per second, pending I/O requests, and disk temperature.
Use the **Devices** dropdown list to select one or all system disks for which you want to display a graph. Use the **Metrics** dropdown list to select one or all disk measurements to display.

### Disk Metrics Options

{{< truetable >}}
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Select All** | Displays all available graphs for any or all disks selected on the **Devices** dropdown list. |
| **Disk Temperature** | Diplays the minimum, maximum and mean temperature reading for the disk selected. |
| **Disk Busy** | Displays the percent the selected disk is busy. |
| **Disk Latency** | Displays the disk latency in time (msec) for read, write and delete operations. |
| **Disk Operations detailed** | Displays the read, write and delete operations for the selected disk. |
| **Pending I/O** | Displays then length of pending I/O requests for the selected disk. |
| **Disk I/O** | Displays the disk read and write I/O stats in bytes/s. |
{{< /truetable >}}

{{< hint type=important >}}
Temperature monitoring for the disk is disabled if **HDD Standby** is enabled. Check the **Storage > Disks** **Edit Disk*** configuration form for any or all disks in the system if you do not see the temperature monitoring graph.

{{< expand "Memory Graphs" "v" >}}
[Memory](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Memory) graphs display memory usage and [swap](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Swap) graphs display the amount of free and used swap space.

![ReportingMemoryTab](/images/CORE/Reporting/ReportingMemoryTab.png "Memory Reporting")

{{< /expand >}}
{{< expand "Network Graphs" "v" >}}
[Network](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Interface) graphs report received and transmitted traffic in megabytes per second for each configured interface.

![ReportingNetworkTab](/images/CORE/Reporting/ReportingNetworkTab.png "Network Reporting")

{{< /expand >}}
{{< expand "NFS Graphs" "v" >}}
[NFS](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:NFS) graphs show information about the number of procedure calls for each procedure and whether the system is a server or client.

![ReportingNFSTab](/images/CORE/Reporting/ReportingNFSTab.png "NFS Reporting")

{{< /expand >}}
{{< expand "Partition Graphs" "v" >}}

[Partition](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:DF) graphs displays free, used, and reserved space for each pool and dataset. However, the disk space used by an individual zvol is not displayed as it is a block device.

![ReportingPartitionTab](/images/CORE/Reporting/ReportingPartitionTab.png "Partition Reporting")

{{< /expand >}}
{{< expand "System Graphs" "v" >}}
[System](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Processes) graphs displays the number of processes. It is grouped by state.

![ReportingSystemTab](/images/CORE/Reporting/ReportingSystemTab.png "System Reporting")
