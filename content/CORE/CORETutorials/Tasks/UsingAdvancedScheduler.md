![Tasks Advanced Scheduler](/images/CORE/Tasks/TasksAdvancedScheduler.png "Tasks Advanced Scheduler")

Choosing a **Presets** option automatically populates all fields.

To customize a schedule, enter [crontab](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?crontab(5)) values for the **Minutes**/**Hours**/**Days**.

The simplest option is to enter a single number in the field.
The task runs when the time value matches that number.
Entering *10* runs the task when the time is ten minutes past the hour.

An asterisk (_*_) matches all values.

Set specific time ranges by entering hyphenated number values.
Entering *30-35* in the **Minutes** field runs the task at minutes 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35.

You can list individual values separated by a comma (*,*).
Entering *1,14* in the **Hours** field runs the task at 1:00 AM (0100) and 2:00 PM (1400).

A slash (*/*) designates a step value.
Entering _*_ in **Days** runs the task every day of the month, while _*/2_ runs it every other day.

Combining all the above examples creates a schedule running a task each minute from 1:30-1:35 AM and 2:30-2:35 PM every other day.

There is an option to select which **Months** the task runs.
Leaving each month unset is the same as selecting every month.

The **Days of Week** schedules the task to run on specific days plus any listed days.
Entering *1* in **Days** and setting *Wed* for **Days of Week** creates a schedule that starts a task on the first day of the month *and* every Wednesday of the month.

The **Schedule Preview** displays when the current settings mean the task runs.

You can specify days as days of the month or days of the week.

With these options, you can create flexible schedules similar to these examples:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Desired schedule</th>
			<th>Values to enter</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>3 times a day (at midnight, 08:00 and 16:00)</td>
			<td>months=*; days=*; hours=0/8 or 0,8,16; minutes=0<br/>(Meaning: every day of every month, when hours=0/8/16 and minutes=0)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, at 8.30 pm</td>
			<td>months=*; days=mon,wed,fri; hours=20; minutes=30</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1st and 15th day of the month, during October to June, at 00:01 am</td>
			<td>months=oct-dec,jan-jun; days=1,15; hours=0; minutes=1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Every 15 minutes during the working week, which is 8am - 7pm (08:00 - 19:00) Monday to Friday</td>
			<td>Note that this requires two tasks to achieve:<br/>(1) months=*; days=mon-fri; hours=8-18; minutes=*/15<br/>(2) months=*; days=mon-fri; hours=19; minutes=0<br/>We need the second scheduled item, to execute at 19:00, otherwise we would stop at 18:45. Another workaround is to stop at 18:45 or 19:45 rather than 19:00.</td>
