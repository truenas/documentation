Google Drive and G Suite are widely used to create and share documents, spreadsheets, and presentations with team members.

Although cloud-based tools have inherent backups and replications included by the cloud provider, certain users may require additional backup or archive capabilities.

For example, companies using G Suite for important work may need to keep records for years, potentially beyond the scope of the G Suite subscription.

TrueNAS can easily back up Google Drive using its built-in cloud sync.

### Set up Google Drive Credentials

Go to **System > Cloud Credentials** and click **ADD**.
Name the Credential and select **Google Drive** as the Provider. 
Click **LOGIN TO PROVIDER** and log in with the appropriate Google user account.

Google requests permission to access all the Google Drive files for the FreeNAS device.

Allow access. The appropriate access key generates in the FreeNAS access token. You may assign a Team ID if necessary. 

Click **VERIFY CREDENTIAL** and wait for it to verify, then click **SUBMIT**

### Create the Cloud Sync Task

Go to **Tasks > Cloud Sync Tasks** and set the backup time frame, frequency, and folders (cloud-based folder and TrueNAS dataset). 
Set whether the synchronization should sync all changes, copy new files, or move files. 
Add a description for the task and select the cloud credentials.
Choose the appropriate cloud folder target and TrueNAS storage location.

Select the file transfer mode: 

+ **Sync**: Keep files newly created or deleted the same.
+ **Copy**: Copy new files to the appropriate target (i.e., TrueNAS pulls files from Google Drive or pushes files to Google Drive).
+ **Move**: Copy files to the target and delete them from the source. With **Move**, users can set a folder in Google Drive for archival and move older documents to that folder from their Drive account. The task would automatically back up the files to the TrueNAS storage.

Once you create the task, attempt a **Dry Run**.

If the Dry Run succeeds, click **SAVE**..

Expand the section down to see the task options.

![CloudSyncTaskNewExpanded](/images/CORE/Tasks/CloudSyncTaskNewExpanded.png "Cloud Sync Task New Expanded")

Clicking **RUN NOW** prompts the task to start immediately.

![CloudSyncTaskStarted](/images/CORE/Tasks/CloudSyncTaskStarted.png "Cloud Sync Task Started")

![CloudSyncTaskRunning](/images/CORE/Tasks/CloudSyncTaskRunning.png "Cloud Sync Task Running")

The web interface shows the status as **RUNNING** and **SUCCESS** upon completion. You can see details in the **Task Manager**.  While the task runs, clicking on the **RUNNING** button reveals a popup log.

Once the sync reports **SUCCESS**, you can verify it by opening the folder on another computer if it is a share, through SSH access, or by checking the destination directory through the TrueNAS CLI.
