{{< hint type=note >}}
This article only applies to FreeNAS or TrueNAS version 11.3.
The **Legacy** replication option in this version provides compatibility with the replication engine used in FreeNAS/TrueNAS 11.2 and earlier.

Creating a legacy replication requires creating an SSH connection to the remote system and snapshots generated by a periodic snapshot task.

## Process Summary

* Create SSH connection to remote system in **System > SSH Connections**
* Create a periodic snapshot task of the source datasets in **Tasks > Periodic Snapshot Tasks**
* Go to **Tasks > Replication Tasks** and open the advanced creation screen.
  * Set **Transport** to **LEGACY**
  * Select SSH connection to remote system
  * Choose source datasets related to the periodic snapshot task
  * Set a target location on the remote system

## Creating a Legacy Engine Replication

1. Go to **Tasks > Replication Tasks** and click **ADD**.
2. Select **Advanced Replication**.
3. Select **LEGACY** for the replication **Transport** method to reorganize the screen for the relevant options.

4. Choose the SSH connection to a remote system that stores replicated snapshots.
5. Select the source datasets on the local system using the file browser or manually enter the dataset paths into the field.
   To also replicate snapshots of child datasets, set **Recursive**.
6. To choose the replication target, open the file browser and select the dataset to store snapshots.
   Entering a path to a new dataset creates that target dataset in the defined file path.
7. The remaining options allow defining how long to keep replicated snapshots, compressing data before replication, and setting a bandwidth limit on the transfer.
