TrueNAS can act as a certificate authority (CA).
When encrypting SSL or TLS connections to the TrueNAS system, you can import an existing CA or create a CA and certificate on the TrueNAS system.
The certificate appears on the dropdown menus for services that support SSL or TLS.

Go to **System > CAs** and click **ADD**. Enter a name for the CA, then choose the type from the **Type** dropdown list of three, **Internal CA**, **Intermediate CA**, or **Import CA**. The process to add a CA for each type is slightly different.

## Creating CA

A CA must exist in CORE to add an Intermediate CA. This can be an internal or imported CA.

To create a CA:

1. Enter or select the **Identifier and Type** setting options.

   ![AddInternalCAIdentTypeNoProfile](/images/CORE/System/AddInternalCAIdentTypeNoProfile.png "Add Internal CA Name and Type")

   a. Enter a name for this CA.
   b. Select **Internal CA** from the **Type** dropdown list to create an internal certificate.
      Select **Intermediate CA** to create an intermediate certificate. This displays the **Signing Certificate Authority** field in **Certificate Options**.

2. Select an option from the **Profiles** dropdown list.
   A profile for the CA auto-fills options like **Key Type**, **Key Length**, and **Digest Algorithm**. Otherwise, you must set options manually.

   To add an OpenVPN Root CA, select **OpenVPN Root CA**.
   The configuration form populates with default settings, enables **Basic Constraints**, **Authority Key Identifier**, **Extended Key Usage**, and **Key Usage**, and sets the options for each extension.

   ![AddInternalCAOpenVPNRootProfile](/images/CORE/System/AddInternalCAOpenVPNRootProfile.png "Add OpenVPN Root CA Profile")

   To add CA certificate, select **CA**.
   The configuration form populates with default settings, enables **Basic Constraints**, **Authority Key Identifier**, **Extended Key Usage**, and **Key Usage**, and sets the options for each extension.

3. Select the **Certificate Options**.

   ![AddInternalCACertOptionsNoProfile](/images/CORE/System/AddInternalCACertOptionsNoProfile.png "Add Internal CA Certificate Options")

   a. Select a **Key Type** from the dropdown list. We recommend the **RSA** key type. Use **EC** for elliptic curve certificates.

   b. Select the **Key Length**. We recommend a minimum of **2048** for security reasons.

   c. Select a **Digest Algorithm**. We recommend **SHA256**.

   d. Enter the **Lifetime** of the CA in days to set how long the CA remains valid.

4. Enter or select the **Certificate Subject** settings.

   ![AddInternalCertSubject](/images/CORE/System/AddInternalCertSubject.png "Internal Certificate Subject Settings")

   a. Enter the geographic information in **Country**, **Locality**, **Organizational Unit** (optional), **Common Name**, **State**, **Organization**, **Email**, and **Subject Alternate Names**.

   b. (Optional) Enter a [fully-qualified hostname (FQDN)](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aiuv) that is unique within a certificate chain in **Common Name**.

5. Select enable and select extensions to use if you did not select an option in **Profiles**. If manually selecting and entering extension:

   ![AddInternalCertExtensions](/images/CORE/System/AddInternalCertExtensions.png "Internal Certificate Extension Options")

   a. Select **Enable**, then enter the extensions for **Basic Constraints**.
  
      Enter a value in **Path Length** that determines how many non-self-issued intermediate certificates can follow the certificate in a valid certification path.
      Entering **0** allows a single additional certificate to follow in the certificate path. Then select the extension(s) to use.

      Select an option from the **Basic Constraints Config** dropdown list. Select **CA** to use a certificate authority.
      Selecting **Critical Extension** can result in rejection of the certificate by the system that is using the certificate if that system does not recognize the extension.

   b. Select **Enable**, then enter the extensions for **Authority Key Identifier**.

      Enabling **Authority Key Config** adds the authority key identifier extension which provides a means of identifying the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign the certificate. Used when an issue has multiple signing keys, possibly due to multiple concurrent key pairs or due to changeover. Options are **Authority Cert Issuer** or **Critical Extension**.

   c. Select **Enable**, then enter the extensions for **Extended Key Usage**. Select one or more usages for the public key from the **Usages** dropdown list.
      TrueNAS uses Extended Key Usage for end-entity certificates.

      Enable **Critical Extension** to identify this extension as critical for the certificate.
      Do not enable **Critical Extension** if **Usages** contains **ANY_EXTENDED_KEY_USAGE**.

      Using **Extended Key Usage** and **Key Usage** extensions requires that the certificate purpose is consistent with both extensions. See [RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.13](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) for more details.

6. Click **Submit** to create the CA.

## Importing a CA
Use this procedure to import a CA.

1. Enter a name for this certificate.

   ![ImportCA](/images/CORE/System/ImportCA.png "Import CA")

2. Select **Import CA** from the **Type** dropdown list.
  
3. Copy the certificate for the CA you want to import and paste it into the **Certificate** field.  

4. Paste the certificate private key of at least 1024 bits in length into **Private Key** when available.

5. Enter and confirm the passphrase for the private key into **Passphrase** and **Confirm Passphrase**.

6. Click **Submit**.

## Deleting a CA

Before deleting a CA, verify it is not used by another service such as S3, FTP, etc. You cannot delete a CA when in use by other services.

Also, before you can delete a CA, you need to delete certificates issued by the CA or those relying on the CA. 
If you receive an error that mentions foreign keys reference, ensure the certificates on your system do not use the CA you want to delete.
