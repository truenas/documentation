Rsync is an open source cross-platform file transfer and synchronization utility. It is a fast and secure way to copy data to another system for backup or to migrate data to a new system.
Use the default settings unless you require a specific change. Don't forget to click **SAVE** after changing any settings.

Log in to the TrueNAS web interface and go to **Services > Rsync**. Click the <span class="material-icons">edit</span> icon to edit the Rsync settings.

## Rsync Configuration Screen

Enter the **TCP Port** you want Rsync to listen on, then enter any [rsyncd.conf(5)](https://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsyncd.conf.html) **Auxiliary Parameters**.
