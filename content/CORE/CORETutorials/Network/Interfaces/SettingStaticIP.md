**Disruptive Change**

It is possible to make changes to the network interface that the web interface uses. But this can result in losing connection to the TrueNAS system!
Very often fixing misconfigured network settings requires command line knowledge. Physical access to the system is often required as well.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< include file="/static/includes/MultipleInterfacesOnNetwork.md" >}}

{{< expand "Process Summary" "v" >}}
Configuring a static IP address involves both the TrueNAS web UI and the Console Setup menu.

* Web UI
  * **Network > Interfaces** > **Add** or **Edit**
    * Type address into **IP Address** and select a subnet mask.
    * **Add** or **Delete** additional addresses as needed.
  * Test saved changes before permanently applying them.
    * Dialog asks to temporarily apply changes.
    * After you apply the network settings changes, they don't immediately become permanent. You can choose the amount of time the new settings will work as temporary settings. After this designated amount of time, the new network settings become permanent if you save them. Saving the new network changes overwrites the previous configuration.
  * **Network > Network Summary** summarizes addressing information of every configured interface.
* Console menu 
  * Physical Interfaces: select **Configure Network Interfaces** (options are similar for other interface types)    
    * Delete interface? enter or select `n`
    * Remove interface settings? enter or select `n`
    * Configure IPv4? enter or select `y`
      * Enter IP address and subnet mask
    * Configure IPv6 enter or select `y`
      * Enter IP address
    * Configure failover? enter or select `n`
  * Saving changes interrupts the web interface and could require a system reboot.

## Setting Static IP Addresses

TrueNAS can configure physical network interfaces with static IP addresses. Use either the web interface or the system console menu.

{{< hint type=tip >}}
The recommendation is to use the web interface for this process. There are extra safety features to prevent saving misconfigured interface settings.
{{< /hint >}}

### Adding Static IP Addresses Using the Web Interface

Log in to the web interface and go to **Network > Interfaces**.
This contains creation and configuration options for physical and virtual network interfaces.

{{< trueimage src="/images/CORE/Network/NetworkInterfaces.png" alt="Interfaces List" id="Interfaces List" >}}

You can configure static IP addresses while creating or editing an interface.

{{< hint type=tip >}}
To edit an active interface on TrueNAS Enterprise systems, you must first disable [High Availability]({{< relref "CORE/UIReference/System/Failover.md" >}}).
{{< /hint >}}

{{< trueimage src="/images/CORE/Network/NetworkInterfacesEdit.png" alt="Editing an Interface" id="Editing an Interface" >}}

Type the desired address in the **IP Address** field and select a subnet mask.

{{< hint type=important >}}
Multiple interfaces cannot be members of the same subnet.

If an error displays when setting the IP addresses on multiple interfaces, check the subnet.
{{< /hint >}}

Use the buttons to **Add** and **Delete** more IP addresses as needed.

To avoid saving invalid or unusable settings, network changes are at first temporary.
Applying any interface changes adds a dialog to the **Network > Interfaces** list.

{{< trueimage src="/images/CORE/Network/NetworkInterfacesChangesPresent.png" alt="Interface Changes Detected" id="Interface Changes Detected" >}}

You can adjust how long to test the network changes before they revert back to the previous settings.
If the test is successful, another dialog allows making the network changes permanent.

To view system networking settings, go to **Network > Network Summary**.

{{< trueimage src="/images/CORE/Network/NetworkSummary.png" alt="Network Summary" id="Network Summary" >}}

### Using the System Console Menu to Assign Static IP Addresses to a Physical Interface

You need to have a monitor and keyboard attached to the system to use the console. If the system hardware allows it, you can connect with [IPMI]({{< relref "CORE/CORETutorials/Network/IPMI.md" >}}).
The console menu displays after the system completes booting.

{{< trueimage src="/images/CORE/ConsoleSetupMenu.png" alt="TrueNAS Console Setup Menu" id="TrueNAS Console Setup Menu" >}}

To add static IP addresses to a physical interface, go to **Configure Network Interfaces**.
Other interface types have a similar process to add static IP addresses.
Interfaces that are already configured for DHCP have that option disabled.
There are many prompts to answer before you can add a static address.
This example shows adding static IPv4 addresses to interface *igb0*:
{{< expand "Example" >}}
```
  Enter an option from 1-11: 1
  1) igb0
  2) igb1
  Select an interface (q to quit): 1
  Delete interface? (y/n) n
  Remove the current settings of this interface? (This causes a momentary disconne
  ction of the network.) (y/n) n
  Configure IPv4? (y/n) y
  Interface name:
  Several input formats are supported
  Example 1 CIDR Notation:
      192.168.1.1/24
  Example 2 IP and Netmask separate:
      IP: 192.168.1.1
      Netmask: 255.255.255.0, /24 or 24
  IPv4 Address:10.238.15.194/22
  Saving interface configuration: Ok
  Configure IPv6? (y/n) n
  Configure failover settings? (y/n) n
  Restarting network: ok
  Restarting routing: ok
```
{{< /expand >}}
Saving interface configuration changes disrupts the web interface while system networking restarts.
The new settings might need a system reboot to take effect. If the web interface is unavailable, this could also require a reboot. Check if the network interface you changed is the one utilized by the web interface.
