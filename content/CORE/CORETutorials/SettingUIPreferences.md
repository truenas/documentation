## Tuning the Visibility of UI Elements.

Click the **Choose Theme** dropdown list to change the color appearance of the web interface. Select from a range of prebuilt or custom created themes.
The **High Contrast** option offers the most visibility.

Select **Prefer buttons with icons only** when working with limited screen space. This displays icons and tooltips without text labels.

For increased security, clear the **Enable Password Toggle** checkbox.
This removes all the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Visibility">visibility</i> icons next to password fields. It prevents the actual password characters from being visible.

## Creating a Custom Theme

To create a custom theme, click **CREATE NEW THEME**.

   Define color choices as either RGBA or hexadecimal values. Or click a color swatch to open a visual color picker.

5. Go to the **GENERAL** tab and choose the primary, accent, and topbar colors for the theme. The color selections you made in the **COLORS** tab determine the options shown here.
