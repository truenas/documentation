TrueNAS supports (WebDAV), or Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning. WebDAV makes it easy to share a TrueNAS dataset and its contents over the web.

To create a new share, make sure a dataset is available with all the data for sharing.

## Share Configuration

Go to **Sharing > WebDAV Shares** and click **ADD**.

![SharingWebdavAdd](/images/CORE/Sharing/SharingWebdavAdd.png "Creating a WebDAV Share")

Enter a name for the share in **Name** and use the file browser to select the dataset to share.
Enter an optional description for the share in **Description** to help identify it.
To prevent user accounts from modifying the shared data, select **Read Only**.  

{{< hint type=important >}}
The default selection is **Change User & Group Ownership**. 
This changes existing ownership of all files in the share to the **webdav** user and group accounts. 
The default selection simplifies WebDAV share permission. This unexpected change causes the web interface to display a warning:
{{< /hint >}}  

![Webdav Add Warning](/images/CORE/Sharing/SharingWebdavAddWarning.png "Services Webdav Add Warning")

Clearing the checkbox labeled **Change User & Group Ownership** prevents the warning from displaying.  You must manually set shared file ownership to the **webdav** or **www** user and group accounts in that case.  

By default, the new WebDAV share is immediately active.
To create the share but not immediately activate it, clear the checkmark in **Enable**.
Click **SUBMIT** to create the share.

## Service Activation

Creating a share immediately opens a dialog to activate the WebDAV service:

It is possible to enable or disable the WebDAV system service at a later time. Go to **Services** and click the **WebDAV** toggle to stop the service. To automatically start the service when TrueNAS boots, select **Start Automatically**. 
Click the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="edit">edit</i> to change the service settings.

For better data security, select **HTTPS** as the **Protocol**.
This requires choosing an SSL certificate. The **freenas_default** certificate is available as an option.
All **Protocol** options require defining a **Port** number.
Verify that the WebDAV service port is not already in use on the network before defining a **Port** number.

Select either **Basic** or **Digest** as the method of **HTTP Authentication**. Create a new **Webdav Password**. This prevents unauthorized access to the shared data. 

Click **SAVE** after making any changes.

## Connecting to the WebDAV Share

WebDAV shared data is accessible from a web browser.
To see the shared data, open a new browser tab and enter the following in the URL field  `{PROTOCOL}://{TRUENASIP}:{PORT}/{SHAREPATH}` where the elements in curly brackets **{}** are your chosen settings from the WebDAV share and service.
Example: *https://10.2.1.1:8081/newdataset*

When the **Authentication** WebDAV service option is configured to either **Basic** or **Digest**, a user name and password is required.
Enter the user name **webdav** and the password defined in the WebDAV service.
