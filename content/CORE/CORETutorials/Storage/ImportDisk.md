Use **Storage > Import Disk** to integrate UFS (BSD Unix), NTFS (Windows), MSDOS (FAT), or EXT2 (Linux) formatted disks into TrueNAS.
This is a one-time import, copying the data from that disk into a TrueNAS dataset.
Only one disk can be imported at a time, and the disk must be installed or physically connected to the TrueNAS system.

{{< expand "What about EXT3 or EXT4 filesystems?" "v" >}}
Importing an EXT3 or EXT4 filesystem is possible in some cases, although neither is fully supported.
EXT3 journaling is not supported, so those file systems must have an external `fsck` utility, like the one provided by [E2fsprogs utilities](https://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/), run on them before import.
EXT4 file systems with extended attributes or inodes greater than 128 bytes are not supported.
EXT4 file systems with EXT3 journaling must have an `fsck` run on them before import, as described above.

![StorageImportDisk](/images/CORE/Storage/StorageImportDisk.png "Import Disk Options")

Use the dropdown list to select the **Disk** to import.

TrueNAS attempts to detect and select the the **Filesystem type**.
Selecting the MSDOSFS file system shows an additional **MSDOSFS locale** dropdown menu.
Use this option to select the locale when non-ASCII characters are present on the disk.

Finally, browse to the ZFS dataset to hold the copied data and define the **Destination Path**.

After clicking **SAVE**, the chosen disk mounts and its contents copied to the specified dataset at the end of the entry in **Destination Path**.
To monitor an in-progress import, open the **Task Manager** by clicking the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Task Manager">assignment</i> in the top menu bar.
The disk unmounts after the copy operation completes.
A dialog allows viewing or downloading the disk import log.

{{< expand "The import was interrupted!" "v" >}}
Use the same import procedure to restart the task.
Choose the same  entry in **Destination Path** as the interrupted import for TrueNAS to scan the destination for previously imported files and resume importing any remaining files.
