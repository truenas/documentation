This tutorial describes how to start a local S3 service on TrueNAS and connect to it from a networked client system with the Minio Browser, s3cmd, and S3 Browser.

{{< expand "Background" "v" >}}
S3 is an object storage protocol used by many major cloud providers including Amazon Web Services™.
On TrueNAS, the service is another way to store files, and can be viewed with a web browser.
Because S3 is the de facto standard for cloud-based storage, setting up an S3 service allows organizations or online application developers to use TrueNAS to replace or archive expensive cloud storage.

## Setting up the S3 service

Go to the **Services** page and find the **S3** entry.

![ServicesS3Enable](/images/CORE/12.0/ServicesS3Enable.png "Services S3 Enable")

Click the toggle to start or stop the service, depending on the current state.
Setting *Start Automatically* starts the service when TrueNAS boots.

Click the <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure"></i> to configure the service.

![ServicesS3Options](/images/CORE/12.0/ServicesS3Options.png "S3 Service Options")

{{< expand "Field Descriptions" "v" >}}
{{< include file="static/includes/ServicesS3Fields.md.part" markdown="true" >}}
{{< /expand >}}

The IP address *0.0.0.0* allows the service to listen on any IPv4 address.
*::* allows the same for any IPv6 address.
Select the TrueNAS IP address to constrain it to a specific network.

Select a clean dataset.
Files are managed by Minio as objects, and can NOT be mixed with other dataset files.
New datasets can be created by going to **Storage > Pools** and clicking <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i> > *Add Dataset*.

Configure the rest of the options as needed in your environment.
Make sure to start the service after saving any changes.

## Minio Connections

When *Enable Browser* is set, test access to the Minio Browser by opening a web browser and typing the TrueNAS IP address with the TCP port.
The chosen *Port* must be allowed through the network firewall to permit bucket creation and file uploads.
For example: `http://192.168.0.3:9000`.

There are different methods for connecting to and using Minio:

{{< tabs "Minio Connection Methods" >}}
{{< tab "s3cmd" >}}
Linux or macOS users must have the [s3cmd](https://s3tools.org/s3cmd) service installed before beginning this setup.
On Windows, users can also refer to [S3Express](https://www.s3express.com/) for a similar command line experience.

{{< hint ok >}}
Ubuntu or other Linux distributions can access the configuration by running `s3cmd --configure` to walk through important settings.
{{< /hint >}}

Enter the specified access key and the secret key.
Under the *S3 Endpoint*, enter the TrueNAS IP address followed by TCP port, and reply *N* to the DNS-style bucket+hostname. 

Save the file.
On Linux, the default is in the home directory <file>\~/.s3cfg</file>.

If the connection has any issues, open <file>.s3cfg</file> again to troubleshoot.
In Ubuntu, use `nano .s3cfg` or `vi .s3cfg` or `gedit .s3cfg` depending on the preferred text editor.
For other operating systems, .s3cfg file location and editing tools may vary. 

Scroll down to the host_bucket area and make sure the %(bucket)s. portion is removed and the address points to the *IP_address:TCP_port* for the system.

**Correct Example**
```
host_base = `192.168.123.207:9000`
host_bucket = `192.168.123.207:9000`
```

**Incorrect Example**
```
host_base = `192.168.123.207`
host_bucket = `%(bucket)s.192.168.123.207`
```

Poll the buckets using `s3cmd ls` to see the buckets created with the Minio Browser.

For more information on using Minio with `s3cmd`, see https://docs.minio.io/docs/s3cmd-with-minio.html and https://s3tools.org/s3cmd.

{{< tab "S3 Browser (Windows)" >}}
On Windows PCs, the S3 Browser is another convenient way to connect to the Minio S3 on a TrueNAS system.

To set it up, first [install the S3 Browser](https://s3-browser.en.uptodown.com/windows).

After installation completes, add a new account. 

![AmazonS3NewAccount](/images/CORE/AmazonS3NewAccount.png "S3 Browser: New Account")

In the settings, select *S3 Compatible Storage* as the *Account Type*, then enter the Minio access point similar to the `s3cmd` setup (TrueNAS_IP_address:9000 or other port if set differently).
Select the SSL settings appropriate for the particular setup.
The default assumes SSL in S3 Browser, but for a LAN attached session, this may or may not have been set.

It is possible to access, create new buckets, or upload files to created buckets.
