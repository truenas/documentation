{{< hint type=info title="Root Login Deprecated" >}}
Root account logins are deprecated in TrueNAS Bluefin 22.12.0 or newer for security hardening and to comply with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).
All TrueNAS users should [create an administrator account]({{< ref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Credentials/ManageUsers" >}}) with all required permissions and begin using it to access TrueNAS.
When the root user password is disabled, only an administrative user account can log in to the TrueNAS web interface.

TrueNAS plans to permanently disable *root* account access in a future release.
