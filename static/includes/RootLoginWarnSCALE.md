{{< hint type=important title="Root Login Deprecated" >}}

Starting with SCALE Bluefin 22.12.0, root account logins are deprecated for security hardening and to comply with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).
All TrueNAS users should [create a local administrator account]({{< ref "/SCALETutorials/Credentials/ManageLocalUsersSCALE" >}}) with all required permissions and begin using it to access TrueNAS.
When the root user password is disabled, only an administrative user account can log in to the TrueNAS web interface.

TrueNAS SCALE plans to permanently disable *root* account access in a future release.
