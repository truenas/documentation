In TrueNAS 25.04 (and later), users must log in as a system administrator with full administrative access to upload or download a system configuration file.
Other users, including restricted admin accounts such as a shares administrator, cannot perform database operations.
See [Using Administrator Logins]({{< ref "/scale/scaletutorials/credentials/adminroles.md" >}}) for more information on admin account types.
