Following the upstream FreeBSD 13.2 end-of-life, announced July 1, 2024, virtualization features (plugins, jails, and virtual machines) in TrueNAS 13.0 are now obsolete.

Enterprise users or community users with a critical need to use containers or virtualization solutions in production should migrate to the tested and supported virtualization features available in [TrueNAS SCALE](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/).
[TrueNAS Enterprise customers](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-enterprise/) can contact iXsystems to schedule a TrueNAS 24.04 or newer deployment.
See [CORE to SCALE Migrations](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/24.04/gettingstarted/migrate/) for more information.
