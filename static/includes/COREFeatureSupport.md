As of TrueNAS 13.3, these features are obsolete and provided without support to the [TrueNAS Community](https://forums.truenas.com/).

Users with a critical need to use containers or virtualization solutions in production should migrate to the tested and supported virtualization features available in [TrueNAS SCALE](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/).

[TrueNAS Enterprise customers](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-enterprise/) can contact iXsystems to schedule a TrueNAS 24.04 or newer deployment.
See [CORE to SCALE Migrations](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/24.04/gettingstarted/migrate/) for more information.
