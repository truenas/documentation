Following the upstream FreeBSD 13.2 end-of-life, announced July 1, 2024, virtualization features (plugins, jails, and virtual machines) in TrueNAS 13.0 are now obsolete.

**Instances** (Incus-powered containers and virtual machines) are an experimental feature intended for community testing only. Developers, testers, and early adopters can migrate to [TrueNAS 25.04](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/) to experiment with instances; however, it is important to note that this feature remains experimental until the release of TrueNAS 25.10. Functionality could change significantly between releases, and instances might not upgrade reliably. Use this feature for testing purposes only and do not rely on it for production workloads.

General and mission-critical users should move to TrueNAS 24.10, as this version provides a stable non-experimental VM feature.

For more guidance, refer to the [Software Status definitions](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/). [TrueNAS Enterprise customers](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-enterprise/) can contact iXsystems to schedule a TrueNAS 24.04 or newer deployment.

See [CORE to SCALE Migrations](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/24.04/gettingstarted/migrate/) for more information.
