#### Allowing Directory Service Users to Access the UI

TrueNAS allows Enterprise users to show the UI to users in an Active Directory group.
To configure this access, first, add the selected AD users to a group that is granted a TrueNAS privilege that permits it, and enable the **Allow Directory Service users to access WebUI** option on the **Access Settings** screen. This option only shows on Enterprise-licensed systems.

After TrueNAS joins AD, it automatically creates a new privilege entry in the **Privileges** screen table, and this privilege is automatically populated with the domain admins group for the domain.
You can edit this privilege by selecting the table row and clicking **Edit**.
Never modify the settings for the standard pre-defined privileges (listed below)! Changing these pre-defined roles can result in lost access to the UI!

Pre-defined TrueNAS privileges are:
* **Read-Only Administrator** - Allows the user to view settings but not make changes in the UI.
* **Sharing Administrator** - Allows the user to create new shares and the share dataset.
* **Local Administrator** - Gives full control (read/write/exeute permissions) to the user.
