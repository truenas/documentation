Static IP addresses set a fixed address for an interface that external devices or websites need to access or remember, such as for VPN access.

Use aliases to add multiple internal IP addresses, representing containers or applications hosted in a VM, to an existing network interface without having to define a separate network interface.

In the UI, you can add aliases when adding or editing an existing interface using the **Add** button to the right of the **Aliases**.
To add a static IP. Click **Add** again to add an additional alias.

From the [Console Setup menu]({{< relref "ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.md" >}}), select option 1 to configure network settings and add alias IP addresses.
