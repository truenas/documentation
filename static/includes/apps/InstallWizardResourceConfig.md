In **Resources Configuration**, accept the default values or enter new CPU and memory values. By default, the app uses no more than 2 CPU cores and 4096 MB of memory. The app might use less system resources.

To customize CPU and memory, enter new values as plain integers (no letter suffix needed). For memory, enter the value in bytes, e.g., *129* (not *129M* or *123MiB*).
