TrueNAS applications allow for quick and easy integration of third-party software and TrueNAS.
The TrueNAS applications backend changed in 24.10 to Docker images managed with Docker Compose.
Earlier TrueNAS releases operated with Kubernetes K3 and Helm providing containers for applications.
For more information on this change refer to the [24.10 Release Notes](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/24.10/gettingstarted/scalereleasenotes/).

TrueNAS applications expand system functionality far beyond what is typically expected from a NAS.

Applications are provided "as-is" and can introduce system stability or security issues when installed.
Make sure the application is required for your specific use requirements and does not violate your security policies before installation.
