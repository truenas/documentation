The **Labels Configuration** settings allow administrative users to create and add [labels](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/services/#labels) to add metadata to containers.
Label-based configuration can define anything and varies based on the environment.
For example, in cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes) where labels apply metadata, in infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) where labels group resources, in software configuration (e.g., feature flags, deployment profiles ) where labels allow setting feature flags, and in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) where labels can set when to execute specific pipeline jobs and under what conditions.

Use **Key** to define the object (pods, nodes, services, feature flag, pipeline build, development cycle, metrics, etc.) that categorizes and filters resources.
Use **Value** to enter the category or filter name for the object.

Select the container (*appname*) from the **Containers** dropdown list to apply the label(s).

Benefits of label-based configurations:
* Flexibility, where you can apply the same configuration to multiple resources and reduce the need for repetitive configurations.
* Scalability, where you can scale configurations to multiple resources without manually updating each resource.
* Automation, where tools can target labeled resources for changes or deployments.
* Environment separation, where you can create distinct environments and configurations for production, staging, etc.
* Management, where you can search resources based on attributes.

Tips for Labels:
* Use a consistent naming convention for labels applied across all systems, for example, *dev=prod*, *env=dev*, *role=web*, *role=db*.
* Use in groupings, for example, when applying configuration changes where labels define or group related resources in a database (*role=db*).
* Combine labels for more granular control, for example, using *env=prod* and *tier=frontend* to distinguish frontend from backend services in production environments.
