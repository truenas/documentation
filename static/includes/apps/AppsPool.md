We recommend users keep the container use case in mind when choosing an applications pool.
Select a pool with enough space for all the application containers you intend to use.

For app stability and performance, we recommend using SSD storage for the apps pool due to their faster speed and resilience for repeated read/writes.

TrueNAS 24.10 and newer creates a hidden **ix-apps** dataset on the apps pool and mounts the hidden directory at <file>/mnt/.ix-apps</file>.
The ix-apps dataset does not inherit encryption if an encrypted pool is selected as the pool for applications.

See [Understanding App Storage](#understanding-app-storage-volumes) for more information about the ix-apps dataset and other app data storage volumes.
