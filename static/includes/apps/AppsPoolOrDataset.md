We recommend users keep the container use case in mind when choosing an applications pool.
Select a pool with enough space for all the application containers you intend to use.

For stability, we recommend using SSD storage for the apps pool.

<!-- Maybe something about preferred storage media, presence absence of other data on the pool, etc. here -->
