The **Custom App** button opens a configuration wizard where users can install applications not included in the approved application catalog train.
Be prepared with all required information and complete preparation steps beginning to use the Custom App wizard.
You cannot leave the configuration wizard to go create data storage or directories, configure network settings, set up certificates, or other functions, and then return to the wizard to find saved settings.

We recommend setting up your storage, user, or other configuration requirements before starting the wizard. You should have access to information such as:

* The path to the image repository
* Any container entrypoint commands or arguments
* Container environment variables
* Network settings
* IP addresses and DNS nameservers
* Container and node port settings
* Storage volume locations
* Certificates for image security
