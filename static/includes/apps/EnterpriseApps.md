TrueNAS Enterprise-licensed systems do not have applications available by default.
To enable applications as part of the Enterprise license, consult with the TrueNAS Support team.

Official TrueNAS support for Enterprise apps falls under two tiers: **Enterprise Deployment Support** and **Enterprise Application Support**.
Please review the [App Support Definitions]({{< ref "/TruenasApps/#app-support-definitions" >}}) and consult with the TrueNAS Support Team for any further clarifications.
