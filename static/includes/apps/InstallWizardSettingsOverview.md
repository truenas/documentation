The installation wizard configuration sections vary by application, with some including more configuration areas than others.
Click **Install** to review settings ahead of time to check for required settings.
Click **Discover** on the breadcrumb at the top of the installation wizard to exit the screen without saving and until you are ready return and configure the app settings.

All apps in the **stable** train, some **community** train apps, and all apps in the **enterprise** train generally include these basic setting sections:

* **Application Name** shows the default name for the application.

  If deploying more than one instance of the application, you must change the default name.

  Do not change the **Version** number for official apps or those included in a TrueNAS catalog.
  When a new version becomes available, the **Installed** application screen shows an update alert, and the **Application Info** widget shows an **Update** button.
  Updating the app changes the version to the currently available release.

* ***Application* Configuration** shows required and optional settings for the app.
    Typical settings include user credentials, environment variables, additional argument settings, the name of the node, or even sizing parameters.

* **User and Group Configuration** shows the user and group ID for the default user assigned to the app.
  If not using a default user and group provided, add a new user to manage the application before using the installation wizard, then enter the UID in both the user and group fields.
  This section is not always included in app installation wizards.

* **Network Configuration** shows network settings the app needs to communicate with TrueNAS and the Internet.
  Settings include the default port assignment, host name, IP addresses, and other network settings.

  If changing the port number to something other than the default setting, refer to [Default Ports](https://www.truenas.com/docs/references/defaultports/) for a list of used and available port numbers.

  Some network configuration settings include the option to add a certificate. Create the certificate authority and certificate before using the installation wizard if using a certificate is required for the application.

* **Storage Configuration** shows options to configure storage for the application.
  Storage configuration can include the primary data mount volume, a configuration volume, postgres volumes, and an option to add additional storage volumes.
  The primary mount volumes have two options:
  * **ixVolume** creates a storage volume inside the hidden **ix-apps** dataset. This is the default setting.
  * **Host Path** allows you to select an existing dataset created for the application. It shows additional fields for selecting the path to the dataset and adding the mount point.

  ixVolumes are not recommended for permanent storage volumes, they are intended for rapid storage for a test deployment of the container.
  We recommend adding datasets and configuring the container storage volumes with the host path option.

  Host paths add existing dataset(s) as the storage volumes.
  You can configure the datasets before beginning the app installation using the wizard or click **Create Dataset** in the app install wizard.

  Some applications require specific storage volumes for configuration and other data.
  Apps with these requirements indicate this in the wizard UI or details screen.
  Refer to tutorials for specifics.

  Depending on the app, storage options can include:
  * **ixVolume**
  * **Host path**
  * **SMB share**
  * **Tmpfs (Temporary directory created on the RAM)**

  See [App Storage](https://apps.truenas.com/getting-started/app-storage/) for more information.

  After configuring required storage volumes you can add additional storage volumes.
  To configure additional storage volumes for the application, click **Add** to select the type of storage to configure.
  
  An SMB share option allows you to mount an SMB share as a Docker volume for the application to use.
  If the application requires specific datasets or you want to allow SMB share access, configure the dataset(s) and SMB share before using the installation wizard.

* **Resources Configuration** shows CPU and memory settings for the container pod.
   In most cases, you can accept the default settings, or you can change these settings to limit the system resources available to the application.

   Some apps include GPU settings if the app allows or requires GPU passthrough.

After installing an app, you can modify most settings by selecting the app on the **Installed** applications screen and then clicking the **Edit** button on the **Application Info** widget for that app.

For more detailed information on application install wizard settings, see each of the tutorials provided in this section.
