{{< expand "Configuring Additional Storage Volumes" "v" >}}
If you choose to configure additional storage volumes, click **Add** to the right of **Additional Storage** to show the **Type** field with three options:
* **HostPath (Path that already exists on the system)**
* **ixVolume (Dataset created automatically by the system)**
* **SMB/CIFS Share (Mounts a volume to a SMB share)**

The host path option requires an existing dataset on the system.
The SMB/CIFS share option shows settings for configuring an SMB share as a storage option.
