All TrueNAS apps are assigned default port numbers.
Accept the default port numbers, but if changing port number assignments, enter a number within the range 1-65535, however, 0-1024 might require the application to have elevated privileges.
Before changing default ports, refer to the TrueNAS [default port list]({{< relref "/solutions/optimizations/security.md #truenas-default-ports" >}}) for a list of assigned and available port numbers.
