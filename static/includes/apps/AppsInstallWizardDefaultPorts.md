All TrueNAS apps are assigned default port numbers.
Accept the default port numbers, but if changing port number assignments, enter a number within the range 9000-65535.
Before changing default ports, refer to the TrueNAS [default port list](https://www.truenas.com/docs/references/defaultports/) for a list of assigned and available port numbers.
