Users often utilize Collabora and Nextcloud together, as Collabora allows users to open and edit documents stored in their Nextcloud account. This integration lets multiple users edit a document simultaneously while providing live comments, suggestions, and version histories.

Users who download the Collabora and Nextcloud applications on TrueNAS can access the **Apps** section in the Nextcloud UI to find the **Collabora Online** application.

After installing Collabora Online, users should navigate to the **Collabora Online** tab in Nextcloud and enter their Collabora server address in the **Collabora Online server** field.

This successfully integrates Collabora and Nextcloud accounts, enhancing document access and editing capabilities.

For more details on installing Nextcloud, visit the [Nextcloud TrueNAS tutorial](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasapps/stableapps/installnextcloudmedia/).
