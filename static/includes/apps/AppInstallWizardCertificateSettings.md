To use a certificate, best practice is to create the self-signed certificate before you begin using the app installation wizard.
If you did not create a certificate before starting the installation wizard you can select the default **TrueNAS** certificate and edit the app to change the certificate after deploying the application.

Select the certificate created in TrueNAS for the app from the **Certificate** dropdown list.
