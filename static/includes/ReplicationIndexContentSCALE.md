Local replication occurs on the same TrueNAS SCALE system using different pools or datasets. 
Remote replication can occur between your TrueNAS SCALE system and another TrueNAS system, or with some other remote server you want to use to store your replicated data.
Local and remote replication can involve encrypted pools or datasets.
