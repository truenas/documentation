With a stable release, upgrading to SCALE 24.04 (Dragonfish) from an earlier SCALE release is primarily done through the web interface [update process]({{< ref "UpdateSCALE" >}}).
Another upgrade option is to use a SCALE **.iso** file to perform a [fresh install]({{< ref "/GettingStarted/Install/" >}}) on the system and then restore a [system configuration file]({{< ref "ManageSysConfigSCALE" >}}).
