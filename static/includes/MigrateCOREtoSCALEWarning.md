{{< hint type=warning title="One-Way Operation" >}}
Migrating TrueNAS from CORE to SCALE is a one-way operation.
Attempting to activate or roll back to a CORE boot environment can break the system.

Upgrade your CORE system to the latest publicly-available version, 13.0-U6.2 (or 13.3 for community users), release before attempting to migrate from CORE to SCALE.
See [Software Releases](https://www.truenas.com/docs/softwarereleases/#upgrade-paths) for current recommended update paths to make sure you download and migrate to the correct SCALE version.
