{{< hint type=warning title="One-Way Operation" >}}
Migrating TrueNAS from FreeBSD- to Linux-based versions is a one-way operation.
Attempting to activate or roll back to a FreeBSD-based TrueNAS boot environment can break the system.

Upgrade your FreeBSD-based TrueNAS system to the latest publicly-available release version, 13.0-U6.2 (or 13.3 for community users), before attempting to migrate.
See [Software Releases]({{< relref "TrueNASUpgrades/_index.md #upgrade-paths" >}}) for current recommended update paths to make sure you download and migrate to the correct version.
