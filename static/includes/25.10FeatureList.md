25.10 (Goldeye) brings many new features and improvements to the TrueNAS experience.

### Redesigned Management Interfaces

The **Updates** screen introduces risk-tolerance profiles for better control over system update notifications, while the refreshed **Users** screen provides improved account management with streamlined user creation workflows and better at-a-glance access to account information.

### Advanced Networking and Storage

TrueNAS 25.10 introduces comprehensive networking enhancements designed for terabit Ethernet performance.
[NVMe over Fabric]({{< ref "SCALETutorials/Shares/NVMe-oF/_index.md" >}}) support includes NVMe/TCP for Community Edition and NVMe/RDMA for Enterprise hardware.
RDMA capabilities eliminate TCP overhead and reduce latency for high-performance storage networking on Enterprise systems.
Updated drivers provide 400GbE network interface support, while enhanced network configuration management improves robustness when transitioning between DHCP and static configurations.

### Virtual Machine Improvements

TrueNAS 25.10 delivers comprehensive virtual machine enhancements including Secure Boot support for enhanced security and refined startup behavior to prevent conflicts between container and VM management interfaces.
VM disk import and export capabilities support multiple formats (QCOW2, QED, RAW, VDI, VHDX, VMDK), streamlining VM migration and setup processes.

### NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Module Support

Support for NVIDIA's open GPU kernel module drivers enables compatibility with the latest graphics cards including the Blackwell architecture.
Modern GPU acceleration capabilities are available for TrueNAS Apps and container workloads.
See [NVIDIA GPU Support]({{< ref "/GettingStarted/VersionNotes.md#nvidia-gpu-support" >}}) for compatibility details.

### ZFS Performance and Stability Improvements

Critical ZFS updates include stability fixes for encrypted snapshot replication, enhanced memory pressure handling, faster pool operations, improved I/O scaling, and new Direct I/O support for better performance in virtualized environments.

### Application Pool Migration

Automatic [migration of existing applications](https://apps.truenas.com/getting-started/initial-setup/#migrating-existing-applications) when changing application pools eliminates manual reconfiguration and reduces downtime during pool transitions.
Support for external container registry mirrors provides alternative sources for Docker images, improving reliability.
