{{< hint type=important >}}
Both controllers must be powered on and ready before you configure network settings.

You must disable the failover service before you can configure network settings!

Only configure network settings on controller 1! When ready to sync to peer, SCALE applies settings to controller 2 at that time.

      First, enter the IP address for controller 1 into **IP Address (This Controller)** and select the netmask (CIDR) number from the dropdown list.

      Next, enter the controller 2 IP address into **IP Address (TrueNAS Controller 2)**.

      Finally, enter the VIP address into **Virtual IP Address (Failover Address)**.
