Application maintenance is independent from TrueNAS SCALE version release cycles.
This means app version information, features, configuration options, and installation behavior at the time of access might vary from those in documented tutorials.

In TrueNAS 24.04 (Dragonfish), the Apps feature is provided using Kuberenetes.

Future versions of TrueNAS, starting with 24.10 (Electric Eel), provide the Apps feature using Docker.
See the [TrueNAS Apps Marketplace](https://apps.truenas.com) for more information.
