To configure individual, per-disk SED passwords, go to **Storage** and click **Disks** in the top right of the screen to open the **Disks** screen.
Click the row or <span class="material-icons">expand_more</span> for a confirmed SED to expand the row.
Click **Edit** to open the **Edit Disk** screen.

Enter and confirm the password in the **SED Password** fields to assign an individual SED password.
If both an individual and global SED password are present, the individual SED password overrides the global password for the disk it is configured on.

Repeat this process for each SED and any SEDs added to the system in the future.
