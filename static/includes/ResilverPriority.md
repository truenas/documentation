Resilvering is a process that copies data to a replacement disk. Complete it as quickly as possible.
Resilvering is a high priority task.
It can run in the background while performing other system functions, however, this can put a higher demand on system resources.
Increasing the priority of resilvers helps them finish faster as the system runs tasks with higher priority ranking.

Use the **Resilver Priority** screen to schedule a time where a resilver task can become a higher priority for the system and when the additional I/O or CPU use does not affect normal usage.
