SCALE has implemented administrator roles to further align with FIPS-compliant encryption and security hardening standards.
The **Sharing Admin** role allows the user to create new shares and datasets, modify the dataset ACL permissions, and to start/restart the sharing service, but does not permit the user to modify users to grant the sharing administrator role to new or existing users.

Full Admin users retain full access control over shares and creating/modifying user accounts.
