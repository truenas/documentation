You cannot access SMB shares with the root user. Change the SMB dataset ownership to the admin user (Full Admin user).

To configure share owner, user and group permissions for the dataset Access Control List (ACL), use the **Edit Filesystem ACL** option.
This modifies the ACL entry for the SMB share the path (defined in **Path**) at the dataset level.
To customize permissions, add Access Control Entries (ACEs) for users or groups.

To access the dataset (filesystem) permissions, click on the <span class="material-icons">more_vert</span> dropdown list to the right of each share then on **Edit Filesystem ACL** to open the **Edit ACL** screen for the dataset assoicated with the share.
You can also go to **Datasets**, select the dataset (same name as the share), then click **Edit** on the **Permissions** widget to open the **Edit ACL** screen.

**Samba Authentication** selected by default when SMB share users are created or added to TrueNAS manually or through a directory service, and these users are automatically added to the **builtin-users** group.
Users in this group can add or modify files and directories in the share.

The share dataset ACL includes an ACE for the **builtin-users** group, and the **@owner** and **@group** are set to **root** by default.
Change the **@owner** and **@group** values to the admin (Full admin) user and click **Apply** under each.

To restrict or grant additional file permissions for some or all share users, do not modify the **builtin-users** group entry.
Best practice is to create a new group for the share users that need different permissions, reassign these users to the new group and remove them from **builtin-users** group.
Next, edit the ACL by adding a new ACE entry for the new group, and then modify the permissions of that group.

Private dataset (home share) users can modify the **builtin-users** group ACE entry to grant **FULL_CONTROL**

If you need to restrict or increase permissions for some share users, create a new group and add an ACE entry with the modified permissions.
