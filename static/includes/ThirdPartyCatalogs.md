{{< hint type=important title= "Third Party App Catalogs"  >}}
For best stability during upgrades to future major versions of TrueNAS, use applications provided by the default TRUENAS catalog.

Third-party app catalogs available for TrueNAS are provided and maintained by individuals or organizations outside of iXsystems.
iXsystems does not provide support for third-party applications, nor can we guarantee app updates and consistent functionality over time.
Users who wish to deploy third-party catalogs should be prepared to self-support installed applications or rely on support services from the catalog provider.
