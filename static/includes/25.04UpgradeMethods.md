With a stable release, upgrading to TrueNAS 25.04 (Fangtooth) from an earlier TrueNAS release is primarily done using the web interface [update process]({{< ref "UpdateSCALE" >}}).
Another upgrade option is to use a TrueNAS **.iso** file to perform a [fresh install]({{< ref "/GettingStarted/Install/" >}}) on the system and then restore a [system configuration file]({{< ref "ManageSysConfigSCALE" >}}).

Migrating to 25.04 from FreeBSD-based TrueNAS 13.0 or 13.3 is primarily done using an **.iso** fresh install and config file restore. See [Migrating from TrueNAS 13.0 or 13.3](/gettingstarted/scalereleasenotes/#migrating-from-truenas-130-or-133) below and the [migration guide](/gettingstarted/migrate/) to prepare your system for migration.
