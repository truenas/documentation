With a stable release, upgrading to SCALE 25.04 (Fangtooth) from an earlier SCALE release is primarily done using the web interface [update process]({{< relref "UpdateSCALE.md" >}}).
Another upgrade option is to use a SCALE **.iso** file to perform a [fresh install]({{< relref "/SCALE/GettingStarted/Install/_index.md" >}}) on the system and then restore a [system configuration file]({{< relref "ManageSysConfigSCALE.md" >}}).
