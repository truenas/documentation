With a stable release, upgrading to TrueNAS 26.04 (Halfmoon) from an earlier TrueNAS release is primarily done using the web interface [update process]({{< ref "UpdateSCALE" >}}).
Another upgrade option is to use a TrueNAS **.iso** file to perform a [fresh install]({{< ref "/SCALE/GettingStarted/Install" >}}) on the system and then restore a [system configuration file]({{< ref "ManageSysConfigSCALE" >}}).
