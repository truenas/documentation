With a stable release, upgrading to TrueNAS 24.10 (Electric Eel) from an earlier release is primarily done using the web interface [update process]({{< ref "UpdateSCALE" >}}).
Another upgrade option is to use an **.iso** file to perform a [fresh install]({{< ref "/GettingStarted/Install/" >}}) on the system and then restore a [system configuration file]({{< ref "ManageSysConfigSCALE" >}}).
