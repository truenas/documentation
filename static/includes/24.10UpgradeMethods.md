With a stable release, upgrading to TrueNAS 24.10 (Electric Eel) from an earlier release is primarily done using the web interface [update process]({{< relref "UpdateSCALE.md" >}}).
Another upgrade option is to use an **.iso** file to perform a [fresh install]({{< relref "/GettingStarted/Install/_index.md" >}}) on the system and then restore a [system configuration file]({{< relref "ManageSysConfigSCALE.md" >}}).
