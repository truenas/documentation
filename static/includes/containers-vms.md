TrueNAS 25.04.2 introduces the [**Virtual Machines**](/scale/scaletutorials/virtualmachines/) screen for creating and managing VMs.

You cannot create new virtual machines using the **Containers** screen in 25.04.2 or later.
New VM creation is only available through the **Virtual Machines** screen.

Virtual machines created using the previous **Instances** feature in earlier 25.04 versions remain fully functional and continue to appear in the **Containers** screen for management purposes.
You can manage these existing VMs using the same tools and procedures described in the [Managing Containers](#managing-containers) section.

Virtual machines automatically migrated from TrueNAS 24.10 to 25.04.2 appear in the new **Virtual Machines** screen and use the updated VM management interface.
