An automatic script sends a nightly email to the administrator account containing important information such as the health of the disks.
Users must [first configure an email address]({{< relref "SettingUpSystemEmail" >}}) for the admin account or another administrative user in [**Credentials > Users**]({{< relref "LocalUsersScreensSCALE" >}}).

The **Email Options** screen offers two options to set up email.
Select either [**SMTP**](#smtp) or [**GMail OAuth**](#gmail-oauth).
The configuration settings change based on the selected radio button.
