There are several fields within the TrueNAS UI that allow users to write custom scripts. It is important to note that when a user writes a password into their custom script, that password is then provided in cleartext form within system debug files, creating a serious security concern.

It is not recommended to use custom scripting on TrueNAS, as it is a highly advanced feature for expert storage administrators and can quickly lead to security breaches.
