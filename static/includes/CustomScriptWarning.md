The TrueNAS UI has several fields that allow users to write custom scripts. When a user writes a password into a custom script, the password is provided in cleartext form within system debug files, creating a serious security concern.

We do not recommend using custom scripting on TrueNAS, as it is a highly advanced feature for expert storage administrators and can lead to security breaches.
