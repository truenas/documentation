24.10 (Electric Eel) brings many new features and improvements to the TrueNAS experience:

{{< columns >}}
* The [TrueNAS Apps](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasapps/) feature backend moves from Kubernetes to Docker to streamline App deployment and management ([announcement](https://forums.truenas.com/t/the-future-of-electric-eel-and-apps/5409)). [Custom App](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasapps/usingcustomapp/) deployment of Docker images is available via a guided wizard or a Compose YAML file.

* [Extend a RAIDZ vdev]({{< relref "ManagePoolsScale/#extending-a-raidz-vdev" >}}) with individual disks (OpenZFS feature sponsored by iXsystems).

* New [TrueCloud Backup Tasks]({{< relref "TrueCloudTasks" >}}) with streamlined functionality for Storj iX cloud backups and restoration.

* New [global search]({{< relref "GlobalSearch" >}}) for finding pages and settings in the TrueNAS UI.

* [Dashboard]({{< relref "/scaletutorials/dashboard/" >}}) reworked with more widgets, data reporting, and customization.

* UI support for NVMe [S.M.A.R.T. tests]({{< relref "SMARTTestsSCALE" >}}).

* Rewrite [TrueNAS installer]({{< relref "installingscale/#using-the-truenas-installer" >}}) to better support future development efforts.

* Polish UI table presentation and integrate with global search ([NAS-127222](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-127222)).
