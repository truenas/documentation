24.10 (Electric Eel) brings many new features and improvements to the TrueNAS SCALE experience:

{{< columns >}}
* The [TrueNAS Apps](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasapps/) feature backend moves from Kubernetes to Docker to streamline App deployment and management ([announcement](https://forums.truenas.com/t/the-future-of-electric-eel-and-apps/5409)). [Custom App](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasapps/usingcustomapp/) deployment of Docker images is available via a guided wizard or a Compose YAML file.

* [Extend a RAIDZ vdev]({{< relref "ManagePoolsScale.md #extending-a-raidz-vdev" >}}) with individual disks (OpenZFS feature sponsored by iXsystems).

* New [TrueCloud Backup Tasks]({{< relref "TrueCloudTasks.md" >}}) with streamlined functionality for Storj iX cloud backups and restoration.

* New [global search]({{< relref "GlobalSearch.md" >}}) for finding pages and settings in the SCALE UI.

* [Dashboard]({{< relref "/scaletutorials/dashboard/_index.md" >}}) reworked with more widgets, data reporting, and customization.

* UI support for NVMe [S.M.A.R.T. tests]({{< relref "SMARTTestsSCALE.md" >}}).

* [Align Enclosure Management]({{< relref "enclosurescreensscale.md" >}}) code with CORE and improve the feature's performance.

* Preserve SMB alternate data streams when [ingesting data from remote servers]({{< relref "DataMigrationSyncthing.md" >}}).

* Rewrite [TrueNAS installer]({{< relref "installingscale.md #using-the-truenas-installer" >}}) to better support future development efforts.

* Polish UI table presentation and integrate with global search ([NAS-127222](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-127222)).

* Replace nslcd with sssd to improve Kerberos, NFS, and SMB support in non-AD environments ([NAS-127073](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-127073)).

* Generate a unique system ID for each SCALE install ([NAS-123519](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-123519)).

* ZFS Fast Deduplication (OpenZFS feature sponsored by iXsystems): This feature is partially present in TrueNAS, but is considered experimental and disabled by default in 24.10.
