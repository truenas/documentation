## TrueNAS Quality Lifecycle

TrueNAS releases follow a general adoption guideline for their lifetime.
Starting with the NIGHTLY builds, each stage of a major release incorporates more testing cycles and bug fixes that represent a maturation of the release.
With each version release stage, users are encouraged to install, upgrade, or otherwise begin using the major version, depending on the specific TrueNAS deployment and use case:
