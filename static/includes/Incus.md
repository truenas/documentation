TrueNAS 25.04 replaces the previous KVM hypervisor (used in TrueNAS 24.10 and earlier) with Incus for virtual machine (VM) deployment.
It also introduces support for Linux system containers (LXC), enabling lightweight isolation similar to jails in TrueNAS CORE.  

This feature is currently experimental and intended for community use.
Full Enterprise support is planned for a future TrueNAS release.
