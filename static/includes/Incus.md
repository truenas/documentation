TrueNAS 25.04 changes the virtualization hypervisor backend from the previous KVM implementation (TrueNAS 24.10 and earlier) to Incus for virtual machine (VM) deployment and adds support for linux system containers (LXC), with lightweight isolation functionality similar to jails in TrueNAS CORE.
This is an experimental community feature, with full Enterprise support planned for a future TrueNAS release version.
