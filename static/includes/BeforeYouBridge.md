Prepare the system for interface changes by stopping apps, VM NIC devices, and services that can cause conflicts.

1. Stop running apps before proceeding with network interface changes.
2. Power off any running virtual machines (VMs) before making interface IP changes.
3. Remove active NIC devices for VMs.

If you encounter issues with testing network changes, you might need to stop sharing services such as SMB, using the current IP address.
