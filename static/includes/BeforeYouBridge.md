Before making network interface changes:

1. Stop running apps.
2. Power off running virtual machines (VMs) and containers.
3. Remove active NIC devices for VMs and containers.

Changing IP address(s) assigned to the primary interface can cause issues with access, so it is best to make changes outside normal working hours.
