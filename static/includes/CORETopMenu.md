### Status Icons

The remaining icons in the top menu show various statuses. They also provide system options.

The <img src="/favicon/tc-favicon-black-32x32.png" alt="TrueCommand Logo"> icon next to the iXsystems logo shows <a href="https://www.truenas.com/truecommand/">TrueCommand Cloud</a> connection options.
Clicking the icon shows options for signing up for TrueCommand Cloud. It also displays options for connecting/disconnecting from TrueCommand Cloud.
When the system is not connected to TrueCommand Cloud the options are not available.
The icon appears but is gray in color.

TrueNAS Enterprise compatible hardware has a <span class="iconify" data-icon="ic:baseline-cloud"></span> (cloud with HA text) icon that shows the current status of High Availability (HA) on the system.
A checkmark (<span class="iconify" data-icon="ic:sharp-cloud-done"></span>) cloud icon indicates HA is functional.
An <span class="iconify" data-icon="bi:x"></span> on top of the cloud icon indicates HA disabled or otherwise unavailable.

### Task Manager

Click the icon to show a list of running or completed TrueNAS tasks.
Tasks are sortable by their success or error **State**, task **Method**, and **Progress**.
Typing text in the <span class="iconify" data-icon="fa:search"></span> **Filter** field shows tasks that match the characters typed into the field.
Clicking an entry shows more details about that task. This includes start and end timestamps.

### Alerts

The <span class="iconify" data-icon="clarity:bell-solid"></span> (bell icon) contains system notification messages.
The icon changes to <span class="iconify" data-icon="clarity:bell-solid-badged"></span> when TrueNAS creates a new alert.
Clicking the icon slides out a panel from the right side of the screen that lists each alert.
Dismiss or reopen alerts in this panel.
Dismissing an alert does not prevent it from recurring. TrueNAS might create a new alert if the alert conditions continue to exist on the system.
Configure the alert system in [System > Alert Settings]({{< ref "AlertSettings" >}}).
