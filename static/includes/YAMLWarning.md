{{< hint type=warning title="Advanced Feature" >}}
Installing custom applications via YAML requires advanced knowledge of [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [YAML Syntax](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/).
Users should be prepared to troubleshoot and debug their own installations.
The [TrueNAS forums](https://forums.truenas.com/c/apps-virt) are available for community support.

TrueNAS applies basic YAML syntax validation to custom applications, but does not apply additional validation of configuration parameters before executing the file as written.
