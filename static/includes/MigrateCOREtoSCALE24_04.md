TrueNAS users wanting to migrate from the latest FreeBSD-based 13.0-U6 or 13.3 CORE release to the Linux-based TrueNAS version 24.10 or later can migrate to 24.04 and earlier using the UI update process, but must clean install if migrating to later releases.
Attempting to migrate directly to 24.10 or later releases using the UI is not supported.

Download a copy of the <file>iso</file> for the latest maintenance release of 24.10 or later, then follow the migration instructions in this Getting Started section of the TrueNAS Documentation Hub to move from the FreeBSD-based to the Linux-based version of TrueNAS.
