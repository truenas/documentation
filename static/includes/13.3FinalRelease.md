{{< hint type="tip" title="13.3 Final Release" >}}
13.3-U1.2 was the final release for the TrueNAS CORE 13.3 software train.
We extend our heartfelt thanks to all our community users journeyed with us throughout the life-cycle of TrueNAS CORE 13.3.

We invite you to explore our newest TrueNAS Community Edition solutions.
[TrueNAS 25.10 (Goldeye)](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/25.10/gettingstarted/scalereleasenotes/) brings improvements to Apps and OpenZFS for both Community and Enterprise users, and is the recommended migration path for current 13.3 installations.

If any security or data integrity issues do arise, we will notify the Community of these.
The expected resolution will be in the TrueNAS Community Edition.
