{{< hint type=important icon=gdoc_info_outline title="Virtual Machines and Containers in TrueNAS 25.10" >}}

TrueNAS 25.04 introduced support for [**Containers**]({{< ref "/scaletutorials/containers/" >}}) (named Instances in pre-25.04.2 releases), enabling lightweight isolation similar to jails in TrueNAS CORE.

In TrueNAS 25.04.2 and later, virtual machines are created and appear on the [**Virtual Machines**]({{< ref "/scaletutorials/virtualmachines/" >}}) screen.
Legacy VMs created in 25.04.0 or 25.04.1 using the Instances feature and some VMs migrated to those versions from TrueNAS 24.10 continue to function and appear on the **Containers** screen.
Legacy VMs on the **Containers** screen do not autostart in 25.10 or later.

Users with existing VMs on the **Containers** screen should consider migrating associated zvols to the **Virtual Machines** screen at this time to ensure compatibility with future TrueNAS releases.
For information on migrating your zvol storage volume to a new VM created in 25.10 or later, see **[Migrating Containers VMs]({{< ref "/SCALETutorials/VirtualMachines/#migrating-containers-vms" >}})**.
