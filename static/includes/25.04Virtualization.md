{{< hint type=important icon=gdoc_notification title="Virtual Machines and Containers in TrueNAS 25.04" >}}

TrueNAS 25.04 introduces support for [**Containers**]({{< ref "/scaletutorials/containers/" >}}) (Linux system containers), enabling lightweight isolation similar to jails in TrueNAS CORE.

TrueNAS 25.04.2 reintroduces "classic virtualization" with the [**Virtual Machines**]({{< ref"/scaletutorials/virtualmachines/" >}}) feature.

VMs created in 25.04.0 or 25.04.1 using the **Instances** feature continue to function and appear on the **Containers** screen.

Virtual machines in 25.04.2 (or later) are created and appear on the **Virtual Machines** screen.

VMs created in 24.10 or earlier are located depending on migration path:

{{< expand "Previously migrated to 25.04.0 or 25.04.1" "v" >}}
- VMs with Zvols that were imported using the **Move** option appear on the **Containers** screen.
- VMs with Zvols that were imported using the **Clone** option appear on the **Virtual Machines** screen.
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Direct upgrade to 25.04.2" "v" >}}
- VMs on 24.10 systems that upgrade directly to 25.04.2 (skipping 25.04.0/25.04.1) automatically migrate to the **Virtual Machines** screen without manual action.

We are actively updating Tutorials and UI Reference articles to reflect these changes.
Please use the Docs Hub **Feedback** button (located to the right of any article) to report documentation issues or
request improvements to the **Containers** or **Virtual Machines** documentation.
