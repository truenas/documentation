With this change, the **Instances** (formerly **Virtualization**) screens in the TrueNAS UI are fully redesigned.
We are actively updating Tutorials and UI Reference articles to reflect these changes.
Please use the Docs Hub **Feedback** button (located to the right of any article) to report documentation issues or request improvements to the **Instances** documentation.
