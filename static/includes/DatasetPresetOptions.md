* **Generic** for non-SMB share datasets such as iSCSI and NFS share datasets or datasets not associated with application storage.
* **Multiprotocol** for datasets optimized for SMB and NFS multi-mode shares or to create a dataset for NFS shares.
* **SMB** for datasets optimized for SMB shares.
* **Apps** for datasets optimized for application storage.

**Generic** sets ACL permissions equivalent to Unix permissions 755, granting the owner full control and the group and other users read and execute privileges.

**SMB**, **Apps**, and **Multiprotocol** inherit ACL permissions based on the parent dataset.
If there is no ACL to inherit, one is calculated granting full control to the owner@, group@, members of the builtin_administrators group, and domain administrators.
Modify control is granted to other members of the builtin_users group and directory services domain users.

**Apps** includes an additional entry granting modify control to group 568 (Apps).
