Although TrueNAS attempts to keep most of your CORE configuration data when upgrading to SCALE, some CORE-specific items do not transfer.
These are the items that don't migrate from CORE:

* FreeBSD GELI encryption.
  If you have GELI-encrypted pools on your system that you plan to import into SCALE, you must migrate your data from the GELI pool to a non-GELI encrypted pool *before* migrating to SCALE.
* Malformed certificates.
  TrueNAS SCALE validates the system certificates when a CORE system migrates to SCALE.
  When a malformed certificate is found, SCALE generates a new self-signed certificate to ensure system accessibility.
* CORE plugins and jails. Save the configuration information for your plugin and back up any stored data.
  After completing the SCALE install, add the equivalent SCALE application using the **Apps** option.
  If your CORE plugin is not listed as an available application in SCALE, use the **Launch Docker Image** option to add it as an application and import data from the backup into a new SCALE dataset for the application.
* NIS data.
* System tunables.
* ZFS boot environments.
* AFP shares also do not transfer, but migrate into an SMB share with AFP compatibility enabled.
* CORE `netcli` utility. A new CLI utility is used for the [Console Setup Menu]({{< relref "ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.md" >}}) and other commands issued in a CLI.
  By default, any TrueNAS user account with **netcli** as the chosen **Shell** updates to use the **nologin** option instead. See the [Users Screens]({{< relref "LocalUsersScreensSCALE.md#authentication-settings" >}}) reference article for descriptions of all **Shell** options.
* SAS multipath is not supported in TrueNAS SCALE.
* TrueNAS CORE account names beginning with a number are not supported in TrueNAS SCALE.
  Usernames in SCALE must begin with a letter or an underscore.
  Before attempting a CORE to SCALE migration, review the local user accounts and rename or replace any accounts that begin with a numeric character (`0`-`9`).

TrueNAS 13.X and earlier support VMs with UEFI and GRUB bootloaders.
TrueNAS 22.02 and later does not support the GRUB bootloader.
VMs configured with the UEFI bootloader can migrate.
VMs configured with the GRUB bootloader are unable to migrate. 

It is important for all users to double-check the VM configuration and network interface settings before starting the VM.

Init/shutdown scripts transfer, but can break. Review them before use.
