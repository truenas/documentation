Although TrueNAS attempts to keep most of your configuration data when migrating, some items do not transfer.
These are the items that do not migrate:

* Microsoft OneDrive Cloud Sync credentials and tasks. OneDrive compatibility is not available in TrueNAS.
* FreeBSD GELI encryption.
  If you have GELI-encrypted pools on your system that you plan to import, you must migrate your data from the GELI pool to a non-GELI encrypted pool *before* migrating.
* Malformed certificates.
  TrueNAS validates the system certificates when a system migrates.
  When a malformed certificate is found, TrueNAS generates a new self-signed certificate to ensure system accessibility.
* Plugins and jails.
  Save the configuration information for your plugin and back up any stored data.
  After migrating, add the equivalent application using the **Apps** option.
  If your plugin is not listed as an available application, use the **Custom App** option to add it and import data from the backup into a new dataset for the application.
* NIS data.
* System tunables.
* ZFS boot environments.
* SMB auxiliary parameters.
  As of TrueNAS 23.10 (Cobia), the **Auxiliary Parameters** option is no longer available in the UI as a configurable option.
  We recommend removing any auxiliary parameter settings before migrating.
* AFP shares also do not transfer, but migrate into an SMB share with AFP compatibility enabled.
* `netcli` utility.
  A new CLI utility is used for the [Console Setup Menu]({{< relref "ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.md" >}}) and other commands issued in a CLI.
  By default, any TrueNAS user account with **netcli** as the chosen **Shell** updates to use the **nologin** option instead. See the [Users Screens]({{< relref "LocalUsersScreensSCALE.md#authentication-settings" >}}) reference article for descriptions of all **Shell** options.
* SAS multipath is not supported.
* TrueNAS 13 account names beginning with a number are not supported in TrueNAS 24.04.
  Usernames must begin with a letter or an underscore.
  Before attempting migration, review the local user accounts and rename or replace any accounts that begin with a numeric character (`0`-`9`).

VM storage and its basic configuration transfer over during a migration, but you need to double-check the VM configuration and the network interface settings specifically before starting the VM.

Init/shutdown scripts transfer, but can break. Review them before use.
