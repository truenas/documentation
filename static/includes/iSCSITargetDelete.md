**Delete** opens a confirmation dialog with two options:
* **Delete *1* associated extent** - Shows the number of associated extend for the selected target.
* **Force Delete** - Deletes the target even if the share is still in use.

**Cancel** closes the dialog without deleting.
**Delete** deletes the target but does not delete the iSCSI volumes associated with the extents.
