What is NVMe-oF?
TrueNAS deployment of NVMe-oF shares provides a block share alternative to iSCSI and iSER available to Enterprise customers with vShpere 7. It is not supported in earlier VMWare releases of vSphere.

Some benefits of NVMe-oF for Enterprise-level customers is lower latency due to streamlined command processing, higher IOPS capabilites, better CPU efficiency with fewer processing layers, and native support for parallelism and queuing.
It does not require specialized network hardware unless deploying over RDMA or Fibre Channel.
Both RDMA and Fibre Channel require TrueNaS Enterprise licenses, and the TrueNAS systems must be equipped with the appropriate hardware to support each transport type.

Why choose NVMe/TCP?
It excels with high-performance databases, virtualization environments, container storage, and for modern applications that require low-latency storage.

Possible use case scenarios for NVMe-of are for system share administrators that want to:
* Edit or disable NVMe-oF block storage shares, and start, restart, or stop the service from the TrueNAS UI
* Get logs of who created the share and when, who makes modifications and when, and who disables NVMe-of shares and when.
* Confirm connectivity and validate credentials during configuration or modification of the shares.
* Allow read-only admins to view NVMe-oF share details but not allow them to edit or delete the shares.

The NVMe-oF services is restored with no data loss during failover in High Availability (HA) systems.
