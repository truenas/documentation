We recommend that only experienced administrators familiar with network configuration and the Console setup menu use it and that less experienced and knowledgeable system administrators use the TrueNAS UI to [configure your network interfaces]({{< relref "/SCALETutorials/Network/Interfaces/_index.md" >}}) and other network configuration settings. 
The TrueNAS UI includes safety measures to prevent you from completely disrupting network connectivity for your TrueNAS if you make a mistake with network interface settings.
