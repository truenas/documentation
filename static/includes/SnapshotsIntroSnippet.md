Snapshots are one of the most powerful features of ZFS.
A *snapshot* provides a read only point-in-time copy of a file system or volume.
This copy does not consume extra space in the ZFS pool.
The snapshot only records the differences between storage block references whenever the data is modified.

Snapshots keep a history of files and provide a way to recover an older or even deleted files.
For this reason, many administrators take regular snapshots, store them for some time, and copy them to a different system.
This strategy allows an administrator to roll the system data back to a specific point in time.
In the event of catastrophic system or disk failure, off-site snapshots can restore data up to the most recent snapshot.
