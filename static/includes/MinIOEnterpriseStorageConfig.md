MinIO storage settings include the option to add storage volumes to use inside the container (pod).
To allow TrueNAS to create a storage volume, leave **Type** set to the default **ixVolume *(Dataset created automatically by the system)**.
This adds a storage volume for the application that can be found nested under the **ix-apps** dataset. To see this, create a recursive snapshot of the **ix-apps** dataset.

To use the **data1** existing dataset, select **Host Path (Path that already exists on the system)** from the **Type** dropdown list.
The **Mount Path** field populates with **/data1** as the first storage volume for a basic installation.
Enter the path or browse to select the **data1** dataset and populate the **Host Path** field.

Click **Add** to the right of **Data Directories** to add the datasets created and representing drives in for multi-mode configurations.
Click **Add** for each additional dataset (**data2**, **data3**, and **data4**).
If you change the configuration of a basic installation or SNMD, you can use the **data1** dataset in the configuration and add the three additional datasets.

Change the **Mount Path** to correspond to the dataset path entered or selected in **Host Path**.Additional mount points are **/data2**, **/data3**, or **/data4**.

When configuring MNMD, create the datasets and repeat the storage settings on each system (node) in the cluster.
