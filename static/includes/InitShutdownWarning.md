Init/shutdown scripts are capable of making OS-level changes and can be dangerous when done incorrectly. Use caution before creating script or command tasks.

Make sure you are comfortable with ZFS, Linux, and system [configuration, backup, and restoration]({{< relref "GeneralSettings.md" >}}) before creating and executing script tasks.
