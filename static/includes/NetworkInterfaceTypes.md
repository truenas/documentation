A **LAGG (Link Aggregation)** optimizes multi-user performance, balances network traffic, and provides network failover protection.
In a failover it prevents a network outage by dynamically reassigning traffic to another interface when a physical link, like a cable or NIC, fails.

A**network bridge** enables communication between two networks and provides a way for them to work as a single network.
Bridges can serve IP addresses to multiple VMs on one interface, which allows your VMs to be on the same network as the host.
