**Instances** (Incus-powered containers and virtual machines) are an experimental feature intended for community testing only.
Functionality could change significantly between releases, and instances might not upgrade reliably.
Use this feature for testing purposes only&mdash;do not rely on it for production workloads.
Long-term stability is planned for future TrueNAS Community Edition releases.

Make all configuration changes using the TrueNAS UI.
Operations using the command line are not supported and might not persist on upgrade.
