After logging in with the root user credentials, you must immediately create the admin user account and then disable the root user password to comply with FIPS security hardening standards.

The root user still exists but with the password disabled by default.
This means only an administrative user can log into the system.

You can activate the password for the root user for some limited uses, but you should return to a security-hardened operation by disabling the root password immediately after you finish with the limited use.
