Want to see a new feature added to TrueNAS?
You can see and vote for community-proposed features in the TrueNAS Community Forum [Feature Requests](https://forums.truenas.com/c/features/) category.
This is the place to suggest improvements and feature functionality to be considered for addition to the TrueNAS development roadmap.

## Submitting and Voting for Requests
A TrueNAS forums account is required to submit or vote for feature suggestions.

To submit a new feature request, click **<i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i> New Topic** in the top right of any forum screen
Enter a title that describes the requested improvement or new functionality.
Change the category tag to **Feature Requests**.
The body of the post populates a template.
Describe the **Problem/Justification**, **Impact**, and provide **User Story** for your request.
Click **<i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i> Create Topic** to submit the request.

{{< trueimage src="/images/SCALE/FeatureRequest.png" alt="Submit a Feature Request" id="Submit a Feature Request" >}}

To vote for a feature request, open that thread then click **Vote** at the top left corner, next to the title.

Each forum user can cast a limited number of votes for items at any given time.
The higher your trust level, the more votes you can cast.
The number of votes based on trust level is as follows:

{{< truetable >}}
| Trust Level | Votes |
|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | 2 |
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 6 |
| 3 | 8 |
| 4 | 10 |
{{< /truetable >}}

Votes on a topic are kept until either you remove the vote manually or the topic is closed.
Topics are closed periodically after they are reviewed and either accepted or rejected based on their merit and feasibility.

## What is a good feature request?

Before creating a new feature request, it is important to take some time to think through the implementation and user story.
A good feature request includes details about the functionality requested, if it involves a UI component, and a detailed user story describing how a TrueNAS user might interact with the proposed feature.

## What is a bad feature request?

Items which are completely unrealistic (i.e. Can you base TrueNAS on Windows) or feature requests which are outside of the scope of typical NAS functionality (i.e. I want a full desktop with Gnome on TrueNAS).
