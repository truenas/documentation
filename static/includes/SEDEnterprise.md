UI management of Self-Encrypting Drives (SED) is an Enterprise-licensed feature in TrueNAS 25.04 (and later).
SED configuration options are not visible in the TrueNAS Community Edition.
Community users wishing to implement SEDs can continue to do so using the command line [sedutil-cli](https://github.com/truenas/sedutil) utility.
