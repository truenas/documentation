{{< expand "What does TrueNAS SCALE use for reporting?" "v" >}}
TrueNAS SCALE uses [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/) to gather metrics, create visualizations, and provide reporting statistics.

Click **Netdata** from the **Reporting** screen to see [the built-in Netdata UI]({{< relref "/scaletutorials/configreportsscale.md#using-the-netdata-ui" >}}).
This UI bases metrics off your local system and browser time, which might be different from the default TrueNAS system time.
