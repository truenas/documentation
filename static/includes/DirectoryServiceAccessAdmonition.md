The **Directory Services** screen and widgets provide access to TrueNAS settings to set up access to directory services and advanced authentication systems deployed in user environments.

TrueNAS does not configure Active Directory domain controllers or LDAP directory servers, nor does it configure Kerberos authentication servers or ID mapping systems.

Refer to documentation for these services and systems for information on how to configure each to suit your use case.
