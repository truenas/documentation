If you want the user to have a home directory, enter the path to the directory and set the default UNIX permissions.
If the directory exists and matches the username, it is set as the user home directory.
When the path does not end with a subdirectory matching the username, a new subdirectory is created.
The home directory full path for the user shows on the Edit NAS User screen.
